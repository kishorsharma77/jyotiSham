      <description>Appendix 1
The only master of this kind of observation hitherto has been Marcel Griaule (d. 1956) but he left an impressive cohort of disciples. They have renewed the understanding of African studies, showing that such systems are still alive with the Dogon, whom Griaule &amp;ldquo;discovered,&amp;rdquo; in the true sense of the word.
As Germaine Dieterlen writes: &amp;ldquo;The smallest everyday object may reveal a conscious reflection of a complex cosmogony .</description>

      <description>Appendix 2
The father of Saxo&amp;rsquo;s Amlethus was Horvandillus, written also Orendel, Erentel, Earendel, Oervandill, Aurvandil, whom the appendix to the Heldenbuch pronounces the first of all heroes that were ever born. The few data known about him are summarized by Jacob Grimm: [1]
 He suffers shipwreck on a voyage, takes shelter with a master fisherman Eisen, [2] earns the seamless coat of his master, and afterwards wins frau Breide, the fairest of women: king Eigel of Trier was his father&amp;rsquo;s name.</description>

      <description>Appendix 3
Now, apart from the circumstance that the snowy burial ascribed to the followers of Kai Khusrau, Enoch, and Quetzalcouatl could hardly be claimed to be an &amp;ldquo;obvious&amp;rdquo; feature, the fate of Quetzalcouatl&amp;rsquo;s companions might further our understanding; more correctly, the topos where this event is supposed to have happened might do so. The &amp;ldquo;five mountains&amp;rdquo; of Mexican myth, their &amp;ldquo;gods&amp;rdquo; respectively, the Tepictoton, [1] appear to represent the five Uayeb (= Maya; with the Aztecs: Nemontemi), the Epagomena, those days gained by Mercury from the Moon during a game of checkers, in order to help Rhea/Nut to days &amp;ldquo;outside of the year,&amp;rdquo; when she could bring forth the five planets.</description>

      <description>Appendix 4
It is as yet too early in the day to deal with &amp;ldquo;Uncle Kamsa,&amp;rdquo; whom lexicographers make a &amp;ldquo;mūra-deva,&amp;rdquo; allegedly a &amp;ldquo;venerator of roots&amp;rdquo; (mūla/mūra = root). In his Kleine Beiträge (p. 11), Jarl Charpentier earnestly wishes us to accept as that &amp;ldquo;among the Indian natives fighting against the invading Aryans there were such,&amp;rdquo; namely, &amp;ldquo;venerators of roots&amp;rdquo; (and venerators of worms as well). Although we do not doubt that the species Homo sapiens is capable of any &amp;ldquo;belief,&amp;rdquo; we cannot perceive any cogent reason for subscribing to Charpentier&amp;rsquo;s view.</description>

      <description>Appendix 6
It is not as easy to dispose of Mysing, as the specialists pretend, e.g., by preferring to interpret his name as &amp;ldquo;mouse-gray&amp;rdquo; instead of the equally possible &amp;ldquo;son of a mouse.&amp;rdquo; Olrik (pp. 459f.) proposes to identify straightaway &amp;ldquo;King Mysing who killed Frith-Frothi, and the cow that struck down Frothi the Peaceful . . . King Mysing is merely a rationalistic explanation of the ancient monster.&amp;rdquo; (For the death of Frodi by means of a sea cow, see also P.</description>

      <description>Appendix 7
We want to stress the point that the haughty verdicts as given by Genzmer, Olrik, and others on Snorri&amp;rsquo;s tale are not unknown to us. Their opinions run along these lines: &amp;ldquo;The last part of the story of Grotti and Mysing is &amp;lsquo;How the sea grew salt.&amp;rsquo; This is a different motif, in no wise connected with the peace of Frothi.&amp;rdquo; [1] Genzmer&amp;rsquo;s wording is more arrogant still. The transportation of the mill by Mysing and the grinding of salt aboard the ship is &amp;ldquo;die Anschweissung einer zweiten selbständigen Sage; der grossartig einfache, ahnungsvolle Schluss unserer Dichtung wird durch ein solches Anhängsel tödlich geschädigt.</description>

      <description>Appendix 8
Vafthrudnismal 35 is rendered by Gering: &amp;ldquo;Ungezählte Winter vor der Schöpfung / geschah Bergelmirs Geburt. / Als frühestes weiss ich, dass der erfahrene Riese / Im Boote geborgen ward.&amp;rdquo; Simrock translates similarly, and he remarks (Hdb. Dt. Myth., § 9): &amp;ldquo;Das dunkle Wort ludr für Boot zu nehmen, sind wir sowohl durch den Zusammenhang als durch die Mythenvergleichung berechtigt.&amp;rdquo;
R. B. Anderson (The Younger Edda [1880], pp. 60f.) translates the verse — quoted by Snorri (Gylf.</description>

      <description>Appendix 9
As a matter of fact, Simrock already (Handbuch der Deutschen Mythologie, pp. 240f.) ventured to interpret Fengö (Amlethus&amp;rsquo; evil uncle) as &amp;ldquo;the grinding,&amp;rdquo; and Amlethus as &amp;ldquo;the grain&amp;rdquo;; &amp;ldquo;wo selbst der Name mit Amelmehl (Greek amylon), Stärkemehl, Kraftmehl übereinstimmt.&amp;rdquo; He even thought of the possibility (although taking this thought for audacious, &amp;ldquo;gewagt&amp;rdquo;) to derive the family name of Thidrek&amp;rsquo;s clan, i.e., the name of the Amelunge, from &amp;ldquo;Amelmehl&amp;rdquo; We shan&amp;rsquo;t dwell upon the strange information given by Athenaeus (Deipnosophistai 3.</description>

Christensen, in his work on the Kayanids, [1] states: &amp;ldquo;La tradition nationale fait grand cas du forgeron Kâvag, qui s&amp;rsquo;insurgeait contre l&amp;rsquo;usurpateur Dahâg (le Dahâka des Yashts) et hissait son tablier de cuir sur une lance, ce qui flit l&amp;rsquo;origine du drapeau de l&amp;rsquo;empire sassanide, appelé drafš ê kâvyân, &amp;lsquo;drapeau de Kâvag.&amp;rsquo; Cette légende, née d&amp;rsquo;un malentendu, la vraie signification du nom de drafš ê kâvyân étant &amp;rsquo;le drapeau royal,&amp;rsquo; est inconnue dans la tradition religieuse.</description>

      <description>Appendix 12
It should be stressed that the disinclination of philologists to allow for the &amp;ldquo;essential&amp;rdquo; connection of Chronos and Kronos rests upon the stern belief that the &amp;ldquo;god&amp;rdquo; Saturn has nothing to do with the planet Saturn, and upon the supposition that an expert in classical philology has nothing whatever to learn from Indian texts. Were it not so, they might have stumbled over Kāla, i.e., Chronos, as a name of Yama, i.</description>

 Some say, he bid his angels turn askance
  The poles of earth, twice ten degrees and more
  From the sun&amp;rsquo;s axle, they with labour pushed

The name Mundilfoeri (Mundel-fere) raises a cluster of problems, and nothing is gained by evasive statements such as that given by de Vries (Altnord. Etym. Wb., p. 395): &amp;ldquo;Mundilferi. Name of the father of the Moon . . . Mundill. Name of a legendary figure.&amp;rdquo;
As concerns mund, feminine, it means &amp;ldquo;hand&amp;rdquo; (Cleasby-Vigfusson, s.v.), but mund comprises the meaning of tutelage, guardianship (cf. German Vormund). Mund as a neutrum means &amp;ldquo;point of time, mood, humor, measure, and the right time&amp;rdquo; (de Vries, loc.</description>

As concerns the removing of the Pole star, the most drastic version is told by the Lapps:
 When Arcturus (alpha Bootis, supposed to be an archer, Ursa Major being his bow) shoots down the North Nail with his arrow on the last day, the heaven will fall, crushing the earth and setting fire to everything. [1]
 Other legends prefer to deal with the fate of circumpolar stars, the result being the same.</description>

      <description>Appendix 17
To prevent rash critics from hurling into our faces the — maybe they will style it thus — “complete absence of technological knowledge,&amp;quot; we hasten to assert that the relevant inquiries are not as foreign to us as they might assume. [1] Curwen might point to his enlightened sentence:
 We are, happily, emerging from that state of blissful ignorance of the subject which made possible such an anachronism as Décamps&amp;rsquo; well-known picture of &amp;ldquo;Samson grinding in the Prison-house,&amp;rdquo; wherein Samson is seen turning a huge mill-stone by means of a long lever like a capstan-bar, after the fashion of the Roman slaves a thousand years later.</description>

Compare Popol Vuh: The Sacred Book of the Ancient Quiché Maya (Eng. trans. by D. Goetz and S. Morley, [1951], pp. 90-102). As concerns the escape of Zipacna, compare the distribution map, given by Frobenius (Paideuma 1 [1938], p. 8, map 3 — &amp;ldquo;Der Lausbub im Haus pfeiler&amp;rdquo;).
For the whole motif of pillars and houses pulled down, compare Eduard Stucken, Astralmythen (1896-1907): pp. 73f. for the death of Nebrôd, according to Cedrenus — of Cain, according to Leo Grammaticus Chron.</description>

      <description>Appendix 19
A remarkable amount of information about submarine creatures is contained in Mansikka&amp;rsquo;s inquiry into Russian magic formulae, already mentioned; [1] intermingled as the material is with the author&amp;rsquo;s rather violent &amp;ldquo;interpretatio christiana,&amp;rdquo; it is well-nigh impossible to lay one&amp;rsquo;s hands on the bare facts. This much can be said, however: in the middle of the &amp;ldquo;Blue Sea&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;the middle of the whole earth&amp;rdquo;), there is either (a) an island-most of the time called Bujan, from the same radical as buoy — “the center of celestial power,&amp;quot; upon which there is a tree, or a stone, or a tree upon a stone, sometimes the cross or the &amp;ldquo;mountain of Zion&amp;rdquo; itself; [2] or there is (b) the &amp;ldquo;White Altar-Stone,&amp;rdquo; which is a &amp;ldquo;fiery&amp;rdquo; one, lying in the navel of the sea without being supported by an island; under this stone, there is &amp;ldquo;a green fire, the king of all fires,&amp;rdquo; or an &amp;ldquo;eternal, unquenchable fire&amp;rdquo; that &amp;ldquo;has to be procured from under the stone&amp;rdquo; (Mansikka, p.</description>

Such stories are no jokes, although they make this impression when they cross our way in Eurasian folklore. &amp;ldquo;Air&amp;rdquo; is a strictly astronomical and, therefore, also a &amp;ldquo;religious&amp;rdquo; term. Thus, we hear from Rabbi Eleazar b. Pedath (ca. A.D. 270): &amp;ldquo;Als def Pharaoh aus Agypten auszog, die Israeliten zu verfolgen, erhoben sie ihre Augen gen Himmel und sahen den Engelsfürsten Ägyptens in der Luft fliegen.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;That signifies the fall of Egypt,&amp;rdquo; adds Bertholet, who mentions this case in his article on the &amp;ldquo;guardian angel of Persia&amp;rdquo; (Festschrift Pavry, p.</description>

      <description>Appendix 21
A faint, though rather pleasant, echo of such huge events, comes from an Esthonian story about the Lake Eim changing his bed (Grimm, TM, p. 599):
 On his banks lived wild and wicked men, who never mowed the meadows that he watered, nor sowed the fields he fertilized, but robbed and murdered, so that his bright wave was befouled with the blood of the slain. And the lake mourned; and one evening he called his fish together, and mounted with them into the air.</description>

A survival, vague as it is, and evidently mistaking a chariot for a wain, we find in India. The Sūrya-Siddhānta states: &amp;ldquo;In Taurus, the 17th degree, a planet of which the latitude is a little more than two degrees, south, will split the wain of Rohini.&amp;rdquo; [1]
According to Burgess (p. 214), Rohini&amp;rsquo;s (= Aldebaran) wain &amp;ldquo;contains five stars, in the grouping of which Hindu fancy has seen the figure of a wain,&amp;rdquo; i.</description>

See J. Kepler, &amp;ldquo;De Stella Nova in Pede Serpentarii et qui sub ejus exortum de novo iniit Trigono Igneo,&amp;rdquo; in Opera Omnia, ed. C. Frisch (1859), vol. 2, p. 636. See also J. Kepler, &amp;ldquo;De vero anno quo Aeternus Dei Filius humanam naturam . . . assumsit,&amp;rdquo; in Opera Omnia (1863), vol. 4, pp. 346ff.
Kepler was less interested in the revolution of one angle of the trigon through the whole zodiac than in the span of time which the conjunctions needed to pass through all four &amp;ldquo;elements,&amp;rdquo; particularly between conjunctions in the &amp;ldquo;fiery triplicity.</description>

Eduard Stucken (Astralmythen, pp. 190ff.) and, later, F. W. Albright (JAOS 40, pp. 329f.) drew attention to the very same method employed when Rishyasringa, son of Vibhandaka (son of Kashyapa) and a hind, was lured by a courtesan, ordered by King Lomapada, into the latter&amp;rsquo;s town, because only with Rishyasringa present would the country have rain. (Compare H. Luders, &amp;ldquo;Die Sage von Rsyasrnga,&amp;rdquo; in *Philologica *Indica [1940], pp. 1-42; also Luders, &amp;ldquo;Zur Sage von Rsyasrnga,&amp;rdquo; Philologica Indica, pp.</description>

It is not yet securely established what the word sippu means. (See W. Baumgartner, &amp;ldquo;Untersuchungen zu den akkadischen Bauausdrücken,&amp;rdquo; ZA 36 [1925], pp. 27, 63; A. Schott, &amp;ldquo;Zu meiner Übersetzung des Gilgamesh-Epos,&amp;rdquo; ZA 42 [1934], pp. 105f.) For the style of this battle, characterized by Cyrus Gordon as &amp;ldquo;Beltwrestling&amp;rdquo; JNES 7, p. 264), see A. Oppenheim, Or. 17, pp. 29f. &amp;ldquo;They seized each other (by their girdles), like experts they wrestled.</description>

See P. Gössmann, Planetarium Babylonicum (1950), 99: &amp;ldquo;ilDapinu, &amp;rsquo;the prevalent, the strong,&amp;rsquo; surname of Nusku (passim), of Nabu, of Marduk . . . As star-god ilDapinu is the Marduk-star Jupiter, identical with dSUL. PA.E3 . . . , mulUD.AL.TAR . . . Since UD.AL.TAR can also mean the fixed star Procyon, also ilDapinu should have this significance (Jensen, &amp;ldquo;der Furchtbare, Gewaltige (= Humbaba),&amp;rdquo; ZDMG 67, S. 517).&amp;rdquo; (For the identification of Nusku with Mercury, see H.</description>

See A. Oppenheim, “Mesopotamian Mythology,&amp;quot; Or. 17 (1948), p. 40: &amp;ldquo;After Enkidu tossed towards her . . . what is euphemistically termed the &amp;lsquo;right thigh&amp;rsquo; of the bull, the goddess and her devotees performed age-old rites over the part of the bull.&amp;rdquo;

In the GE Enkidu appears later on the stage of events than Gilgamesh. This does not entitle us to take him for the prototype of the &amp;ldquo;younger brother&amp;rdquo; (see, e.g., W. Albright, &amp;ldquo;Gilgamesh and Engidu,&amp;rdquo; JAOS 40 [1920], pp. 312, 318). Actually, the hairy partner of the Twins, the &amp;ldquo;Dog,&amp;rdquo; is the prototype of the older one who is cheated out of his primogeniture in various ways. Esau, the hairy, is the first born; so is Hono-susori no Mikoto (Nihongi, trans.</description>

      <description>Appendix 29
We might call it Lethe, and feel happy about it, were it not for the deplorable uncertainty of Lethe&amp;rsquo;s localization, with respect to the celestial itinerary of the soul particularly. The Milky Way being as large as it is, it does not help to state that one has to look for a galactical section. Worse, it remains unclear at which occasion the souls were supposed to drink from the water of this river of forgetfulness, whether they did so shortly after having arrived in Hades or before their re incarnation, or at both times.</description>

Anton Deimel (Pantheon Babylonicum [1914], pp. 148f.) takes mulGIR.TAB for beta delta alpha Scorpii only: &amp;lsquo;Ishara est dea quaedam partus, quae relationem habet ad Gestin anna, Adad&amp;rsquo;.&amp;quot; See also W.

These unknown factors, crucial as they are, resist successfully every decoding for the time being. Šu-ut abnē, &amp;ldquo;those of stone,&amp;rdquo; represent &amp;ldquo;an expression which recurs and has not been explained&amp;rdquo; (S. Langdon, Semitic Mythology [1931], pp. 213f., 405). Alexander Heidel (The Gilgamesh Epic and Old Testament Parallels [1963], p. 74, n. 157) remarks: &amp;ldquo;The Hittite Version has &amp;rsquo;two images of stone.&amp;rsquo; These images may perhaps have been idols of an apotropaic character enabling Urshanabi to cross the waters of death.</description>

Considering that removed posts or pegs, pulled-out pins, wrecked axles, and felled trees have accompanied this whole investigation as a kind of basso ostinato, we cannot pass in silence over these super-important posts; considering, on the other hand, that technical details are not likely to make pleasant reading, we prefer to deal with this specimen outside the main text, although we deem it essential indeed.

The mere notion of the emperors sleeping makes it clear that they are expected to awake and to return one day; [1] be it Quetzalcouatl (in the heart of the sea), Ogygian Kronos himself, or Arthur, &amp;ldquo;ruler of the lower hemisphere,&amp;rdquo; who announces in a fictitious letter &amp;ldquo;that he has come, with a host of antipodean subjects&amp;rdquo; [2] — according to Étienne de Rouen (c. 1169; see R.

Actually, we are up against a completely incomprehensible narrative of events which occurred during a sea voyage. The plant, according to Albright (AJSL 36, p. 281, n. 2) literally &amp;ldquo;thorny grapevine,&amp;rdquo; is supposed to grow in the apsu, and to be accessible by way of a &amp;ldquo;waterpipe.&amp;rdquo; This pipe, rātu, however, is a conjecture right here: the word occurs only later when, after his bath in a well, and the following loss of the plant, Gilgamesh complains bitterly about his frustration, i.</description>

There are a few dim and blurred signals to be received from the regions of Styx flowing, as we have heard, in sight of the celestial South Pole. Photius [1] tells us about Hyllos, son of Herakles, who had a small horn growing out of the left side of his head, and how Epopeus [2] of Sikyon broke off this horn, after having killed Hyllos in a duel, fetched Styx water with this horn, and became king of the country.</description>

A sidelight falls upon the notions connected with the stag by Hora pollo&amp;rsquo;s statement concerning the Egyptian writing of &amp;ldquo;A long space of time: A Stag&amp;rsquo;s horns grow out each year. A picture of them means a long space of time.&amp;rdquo; [1] Chairemon (hieroglyph no. 15, quoted by Tzetzes) made it shorter: &amp;ldquo;eniautos elaphos.&amp;rdquo; Louis Keimer, stressing the absence of stags in Egypt, pointed to the Oryx (Capra Nubiana) as the appropriate &amp;ldquo;ersatz,&amp;rdquo; [2] whose head was, indeed, used for writing the word rnp = year, eventually in &amp;ldquo;the Lord of the Year,&amp;rdquo; a well-known title of Ptah.</description>

      <description>Appendix 39
Excursus on Gilgamesh
There are many points from which to start new trips of exploration into the Gilgamesh Epic, once it is conceded that reasonable questions have to be asked. Among the many we single out two, without intending to &amp;ldquo;get at the bottom of the matter&amp;rdquo;; the first concerns the &amp;ldquo;ferry-man,&amp;rdquo; the second concerns &amp;ldquo;trees.&amp;rdquo;
Face to face with the ferryman Urshanabi, a kind of personified me who was dragged away from the &amp;ldquo;confluence of the rivers&amp;rdquo; to check the proper measures of Uruk, it can hardly be taken for a farfetched idea that we ask for comparative &amp;ldquo;individuals&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;places&amp;rdquo; in other Mesopotamian texts.</description>
