. . . you of changeful counsel,
undefiled Titan of exceeding
strength, you who consume all
and increase it again you who
hold the indestructible bond by
the unlimited order of the Aeon,
wily-minded, originator of generation,
you of crooked counsel . . .
From the Orphic Hymns

      <description>CHAPTER II — The Figure in Finland
NOW THE DISCUSSION leaps, without apologies, over the impassable fence erected by modern philologists to protect the linguistic family of Indo-European languages from any improper dealings with strange outsiders. It is known that Finland, Esthonia and Lapland are a cultural island, ethnically related to the Hungarians and to other faraway Asian peoples: Siryenians, Votyaks, Cheremissians, Mordvinians, Voguls, Ostyaks. They speak languages which belong to the Ugro-Finnish family, as totally unrelated to Germanic as Basque would be.</description>

Khusrau
Shahnama
THE HAMLET THEME moves now to Persia. Firdausi&amp;rsquo;s Shahnama, the Book of Kings, is the national epic of Iran, [1] and Firdausi (ca. A.D. 1010) is still today the national poet. At the time Firdausi wrote, his protector, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna, had shifted the center of his power to India, and the Iranian empire had long been only a memory.</description>

“Let us try, then, to set forth in
our statement what things these

one should learn them . . . It is,
indeed, a rather strange thing to
hear; but the name that we, at
any rate, give it — one that people

      <description>INTERMEZZO — A Guide for the Perplexed
Tout-puissants étrangers, inévitables astres . . .
VALÉRY, La Jeune Parque
THIS BOOK is highly unconventional, and often the flow of the tales will be interrupted to put in words of guidance, in the fashion of the Middle Ages, to emphasize salient points.
To begin with, there is no system that can be presented in modern analytical terms. There is no key, and there are no principles from which a presentation can be deduced.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER V — The Unfolding in India
They reckon ill who leave me
out.
When Me they fly, I am the
wings;
I am the doubter and the doubt
I am the hymn the Brahmin sings.
EMERSON, Brahma
THE PARALLEL between the Tale of Kai Khusrau and the final plot of the vast Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, has received attention for over a century. It was noticed by the great Orientalist James Darmesteter.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VI — Amlodhi&amp;rsquo;s Quern
The stone which the builders refused
is become the head stone of the corner.
    Psalm CXVIII.22; Luke XX.I7
Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken,
but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
Luke XX.18
WITH SUGGESTIVE INSIGHTS from other continents, it is time to take a fresh look at Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s Gentle Prince, a cultivated, searching intellectual, the glass of fashion and the mold of form in the Danish Court, who was known once upon a time as a personage of no ordinary power, of universal position, and, in the North, as the owner of a formidable mill.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VII — The Many-Colored Cover
There is a mill which grinds by
itself, swings of itself, and scat-
ters the dust a hundred versts
away. And there is a golden pole
with a golden cage on top which
is also the Nail of the North.
And there is a very wise tomcat
which climbs up and down this
pole. When he climbs down, he
sings songs; and when he climbs</description>

Of this base metal may be filed a
key
That will unlock the door they
howl without.
OMAR KHAYYAM
IN ADDITION to the Sampo, there are many myths embedded in the Kalevala&amp;rsquo;s narrative sequence whose analysis would yield surprises. There was the contest of Vainamoinen with Youkahainen (see p. 97), a malevolent Lapp magician who seems to, be his constant opponent. Youkahainen tries to overcome the ancient sage by asking cosmogonic riddles, but Vainamoinen &amp;ldquo;sings&amp;rdquo; the Lapp step by step into the bog up to his throat, and sings his magic formulae &amp;ldquo;backwards&amp;rdquo; to free him only when the Lapp has promised him Aino, his only sister.</description>

Tops of different sorts, and jointed dolls,
and fair golden
apples from the clear-voiced Hesperides . . .
Orpheus the Thracian
Though I am not by nature rash or splenetic
Yet there is in me something dangerous
Which let thy wisdom fear . . .
Hamlet, Act V
A REASONABLE CASE has been made for the extreme antiquity and continuity of certain traditions concerning the heavens.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER X — The Twilight of the Gods
THERE WAS ONCE, then, a Golden Age. Why, how, did it come to an end? This has been a deep concern of mankind over time, refracted in a hundred myths, explained in so many ways which always expressed sorrow, nostalgia, despondency. Why did man lose the Garden of Eden? The answer has always been, because of some original sin. But the idea that man alone was able to commit sin, that Adam and Eve are the guilty ones, is not very old.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER XI — Samson Under Many Skies
Why was my breeding ordered and prescribed
As of a person separate to God,
Designed for great exploits, if I must die
Betrayed, captived, and both my eyes put out . . .
O dark dark dark, amid the blaze of noon,
Irrevocably dark, total eclipse
Without all hope of day!
O first-created beam, and thou great Word,

Al suo aspetto tal dentro mi fei

Che il fe&amp;rsquo; consorto in mar degli altri dei.
DANTE, Paradiso 1.67
WHAT A MAN has to say in the last hours of is life deserves attention. Most especially if that man be Socrates, awaiting execution in his jail and conversing with Pythagorean friends. He has already left the world behind, has made his philosophical will and is now quietly communing with his own truth.</description>

Di, quibus imperium est animarum, umbraeque silentes
Et Chaos et Phlegethon, loca tacentia late

VIRGIL, Aeneid VI.264
SOCRATES&amp;rsquo; INIMITABLE HABIT of discussing serious things while telling an improbable story makes it very much worth while to take a closer look at his strange system of rivers.
It appears again in Virgil, almost as a set piece.</description>

Infin che&amp;rsquo;l mar fu sopra noi richiuso.
DANTE, Inferno
DANTE KEPT to the tradition of the whirlpool as a significant end for great figures, even if here it comes ordained by Providence. Ulysses has sailed in his &amp;ldquo;mad venture&amp;rdquo; beyond the limits of the world, and once he has crossed the ocean he sees a mountain looming far away, &amp;ldquo;hazy with the distance, and so high I had never seen any.</description>

W. H. AUDEN, &amp;ldquo;As I Walked
Out One Evening&amp;rdquo;
THERE IS A TRADITION from Borneo of a &amp;ldquo;Whirlpool island&amp;rdquo; with a tree that allows a man to climb up into heaven and bring back useful seeds from the &amp;ldquo;land of the Pleiades.</description>

THE GROUND, indeed, is not only sensitive but difficult and shifting as well. If the whirlpool turns up in the theory of the Cross, it is certainly without the consent of theologians. Yet the instances so far given are not isolated ones.</description>

MEN&amp;rsquo;s SPIRITS were thought to dwell in the Milky Way between incarnations. This conception has been handed down as an Orphic and Pythagorean tradition [1] fitting into the frame of the migration of the soul.</description>

THE GREAT AND OFFICIAL myth concerning the Galaxy is Phaethon&amp;rsquo;s transgression and the searing of the sky in his mad course. Manilius tells it in his astrological Poem: [1]

Job XXXVIII.16
IT WILL HELP NOW to take a quick comparative look at the different &amp;ldquo;dialects&amp;rdquo; of mythical language as applied to &amp;ldquo;Phaethon&amp;rdquo; in Greece and India. The Pythagoreans make Phaethon fall into Eridanus, burning part of its water, and glowing still at the time when the Argonauts passed by.</description>

EVERYONE HAS ONCE READ, for it comes up many times in literature, of that pilot in the reign of Tiberius, who, as he was sailing along in the Aegean on a quiet evening, heard a loud voice announcing that &amp;ldquo;Great Pan was dead.&amp;rdquo; This engaging myth was interpreted in two contradictory ways. On the one hand, it announced the end of paganism: Pan with his pipes, the demon of still sun-drenched noon, the pagan god of glade and pasture and the rural idyll, had yielded to the supernatural.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER XXII — The Adventure and the Quest
THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH in its first recorded version goes back to Sumerian times. [1] It has been rehearsed with variants by Hurrians and Hittites, by Babylonians and Assyrians. Even in the best recensions there are large gaps, many tablets are damaged beyond repair, and to aggravate these detrimental conditions one must add the efforts of a goodly number of specialists which have not helped to clarify matters.</description>

FIRE IS, INDEED, a key word, deserving a special inquiry. For the time being, however, it is not essential to understand everything about the different norms and measures, rules and regulations which have to be procured by gods or heroes who are destined to open &amp;ldquo;new ways.</description>

      <description>EPILOGUE — The Lost Treasure
by GIORGIO DE SANTILLANA
. . . while each art and science has
often been developed as far as

      <description>Honneur des Hommes, saint Langage
Discours prophétique et paré . . .
VALÉRY, La Pythie
STARTING FROM one theme chosen among many, this self-styled first reconnaissance over uncharted ground has come a long and tortuous way since the early introduction of the Hamlet figure. The discussion has touched immense areas of myth whose probable value was indicated by previous discoveries.
