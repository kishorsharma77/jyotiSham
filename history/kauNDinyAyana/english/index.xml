      <description>Vedic chronology 1: Soni-lunar Uttarayana, beginning of Vedic New Year In this series of articles we will discuss the fundamental principles of Vedic system of chronology and how it is different from the principles currently used in “Hindu calendars”. It will be made clear that well known “Hindu new year” celebrated in sidereal Chaitra Shukla pratipada is neither the beginning of the true Vedic year nor the beginning of Vasanta Ritu, according to Vedic astronomy.</description>

      <description>In this second part of the series on Vedic chronology, we will discuss the ancient units of time along with water clock, method of identifying muhurtas of the day and solstices by measurement of shadow and method of insertion of intercalary month (Adhikamasa) in Vedic system. As Adhikashadha (Second Ashadha/ Intercalary Ashadha) according to Vedic system starts from May 26, we will discuss about the research finding put forward in commentary of Vedanga Jyotisha (VJ) (6) on correct way of insertion of such intercalary month in detail.</description>

      <description>In the previous two articles we had discussed about the beginning of year in soni-lunar Uttarayana i.e. on seasonal Magha Shukla Pratipada, the units of time and correct way of insertion of intercalary month (Adhikamasa) according to Vedic tradition. We discussed some of the verses of Vedanga Jyotisha (abbreviated as VJ in this series) in the context of those discussions. On the occasion of the beginning of Vedic New Year (on December 18) we are discussing about VJ itself, which provides the theoretical foundation of the Vedic calendar.</description>
