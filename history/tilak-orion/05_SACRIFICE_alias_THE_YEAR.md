It is necessary, in the first place, to see what contri vances were adopted by the ancient Aryas for the measure ment and division of time. The present Indian system has been thus described by Professor Whitney in his notes to the Sürya Siddhanta (1. 13, notes): 
" In the ordinary reckoning of time, these elements are u variously combined. Throughout Southern India (see " Warren's Kala Sankalita, Madras, 1825, p. 4, etc.), the " year and month made use of are the solar, and the day the "civil; the beginning of each month and year being M counted, in practice, from the sunrise nearest to the "moment of their actual commencement. In all Northern \* India the year is luoi-solar; the month is lunar and is \* divided into both lunar and civil days; the year is com "posed of a variable number of months, either twelve or # thirteen, beginning always with the lunar month, of which " the commencement next precedes the true commencement \* of the sidercal year. But underneath this division, the \* division of the actual sidereal year into twelve solar months

" is likewise kept up, and to maintain the concurrence of "the civil and lunar days, and the lunar aod solar months, "is a process of great complexity, into the details of which " we need not enter here." 
But the complications here referred to are evidently the growth of later times. The four ways of reckoning time, the Sāvana, the Chāadra, the Nakṣatra and the Saura, are not all referred to in the early works, and even in later days all these measures of time do not appear to have been fully aad systematically utilised. There is, as I have said before, no early work extant on Vedic calendar, except the small tract on Jyotisha, and our information about the oldest calendar must, therefore, be gathered either from stray references in the Vedic works or from the early traditions or practices recorded in the old sacrificial literature of India. There are several sacrificial hymns in the r̥gveda, which show that the sacrificial ceremonies must then have been considerably developed ; and as no sacrificial system could be developed without the knowledge of months, sea. sons, and the year, it will not be too much to presume that in Vedic times there must have existed a calendar to regu. late the sacrifices. It is difficult to determine the exact nature of this calender, but a study of the sacrificial litera ture would show that the phases of the moon, the changes in the seasons, aod the southern and northern courses of the sun were the principal land-marks in the measurement of time in these early days. What is still more interesting, however, is that the leading features in the early sacrifices are the same as those in the year. The late Dr. Haug, in his introduction to the Aitareya Brahmapa, has observed that "the satras, which lasted for one year, were nothing but an imitation of the sun's yearly course. They were divided into two distinct parts, each consisting of six months of 30 days cach. In the midst of both was the Viṣuvān, lo the equator or the central day, cutting the whole satra into two halves.'\*\* This clearly shows that the ancient Riṣis prepared their calendar mainly for sacrificial purposes, and the performance of various sacrifices facilitated, in its turo, the keeping up of the calendar. Offerings were made every morning and evening, on every new and full moon, and at the commencement of every season and ayana, + When this course of sacrifices was thus completed, it was naturally found that the year also had run its course, and the sacri fice and the year, therefore, seem to have early become synonymous terms. There are many passages in the Brāhmaṇas and Sanhilds, where Samvatsara and Yajna are declared to be convertible terms, and no other theory has yet been suggested on which this may be accounted for. I am therefore inclined to believe that the Vedic Riṣis kept up their calendar by performing the corresponding round of sacrifices on the sacred fire that constantly burnt in their houses, like the fire of the Parsi priest in modern times. The numerous sacrificial details, which we find so fully dercribed in the Brāhmaṇas, might be later innovations,

but the main idea of the yearly sacrifice appears to be an old one. The etymology of the word fitvij (ritu + yaj - season sacrificer) shows that even in the oldest days there existed a certain correspondence between the sacrifices and the seasons, and what is true of the seasons is true of the year which according to one derivation of samvatsara (vas - to dwell) is nothing but a period where seasons dwell, or a cycle of seasons. The priests were not only the sacri ficers of the community, but were also its time-keepers, and these two functions they appear to have blended into one by assigning the commencement of the several sacrifices to the leading days of the year, on the natural ground that if the sacrifices were to be performed they must be performed on the principal days of the year.. Some scholars have suggested that the yearly satras might have been subse quently invented by the priests. But the hypothesis derives little support from the oldest records and traditions of all the sections of the Aryan race. Without a yearly satra 
\* Ct, Bhanu Dīkṣita's Com. on Amar a i, 4, 20, Dr. Schrader, in his Prehistoric Antiquities of the Aryan Peo ples, Part iv., Ch. vi. (p. 305) also makes a similar observation. He holds, on philological grounds, that the conception of the year was already formedin the primeval period by combining into one whole the conception of winter and summer, wbich he believes to be the two primeval SCASOns,

regularly kept up a Vedic Rishi could hardly have been able to ascertain and measure the course of time in the way he did. When better contrivances were subsequently discovered the sacrifice might naturally become divested of their time-keeping function and the differentiation so caused might have ultimately led to an independent development of both the sacrifices and the calendar. It is to this stage that we must assign the introduction of the numerous details of the yearly sacrifice mentioned in later works ; and thus understood, the idea of a sacrifice extending over the whole year, may be safely supposed to have originated in the oldest days of the history of the Aryan race. \* In fact, it may be regarded as coeval with, if not antecedent to, the very beginning of the calendar itself. 
We have now to examine the principal parts of the year, alias the sacrifice. The savana or the civil day appears to have been, as its etymology shows,t selected in such cases as the natural unit of time. 30 such days made a month and 12 such months or 360 savana days made a year.

for the month and the moon coincide, with occasional small differeoçes of suffix,\* in most of the Indo-European languages, and we may therefore conclude that in the primitive Aryan times the month was determined by the moon, Now a month of thirty civil or savana days cannot correspond with a lunar synodical month, and the Brahmavadins had therefore to omit a day in some of the savana months to secure the concurrence of the civil and the lunar months. The year of 360 savana days was thus practically reduced to a lunar year of 354 civil days or 360 tithis. But a further correction was necessary to adjust the lunar with the solar reckoning of time. The zodiac was not yet divided into twelve equal parts, and the solar month, as we now under stand it, was unknown. The commencement of the cycle of seasons was, therefore, the only means to correct the calendar, and the ancient Aryas appeared to have early hit upon the device of the intercalary days or month for that purpose. There are many passages in the Taittirīya and Vājasaneyi Saṁhitās and also one in the r̥gvedal wherein the inter calary month is mentioned, and though opinions may differ as to when and how it was inserted, we may, for the purpose of our present inquiry, regard it as undisputed that in the old Vedic days means were devised and adopted to secure

the correspondence of the lunar with the solar year. The occurrence of the twelve hallowed nights amongst the Teutons points to the same conclusion. They were in fact the supplementary days (366-384 - 12) required to balance the lunar with the solar year,--a period when the Ķibhus, or the genii of the seasons, slackened their course and enjoyed the hospitality of the sun after toiling for a whole year (Rig. i. 33. 7.)," and when Prajapati, the God of sacrifices, after finishing the old year's sacrifice, prepared himself for the new year's work (Atharva Veda iv, 11. 11.). The sacrificial literature of India still preserves the memory of these days by ordaining that a person wishing to perform a yearly sacrifice should devote 12 days (dvadashaha) before its commencement to the preparatory rites. These facts, in my opinion, conclusively establish that the primitive Aryans had solved the problem involved in balancing the solar with the lunar year. There may be some doubt as to whether the concurrence of the two years was at first secured by intercalating twelve days at the end of every lugar year, or whether the days were allowed to accumulate until an intercalary month could be inserted. The former appears to - have been the older method, especially as it has been utilised and retained in the performance of yearly sacrifices; but whichsoever may be the older method, one thing is certain, that primitive Aryas had contrived means for adjusting the lunar with the solar year. Prof. Weber and Dr. Schradert appear to doubt the conclusion on the sole ground that we

canoot suppose the primitive Aryans to have so far advanced in civilization as to correctly comprehend such problems, This means that we must refuse to draw legitimate inferences from plaio facts when such inferences conflict with our preconceived notions about the primitive Aryan civilization. I am not disposed to follow this method, nor do I think that people, who knew and worked in metals, made clothing of wool, constructed boats, built houses and chariots, performed sacrifices, and had made some advance in agriculture,\* were incapable of ascertaioing the solar and the lunar year. They could not have determined it correct to a fraction of a second as modern astronomers have done ; but a rough practical estimate was, certainly, not beyond their powers of comprenension. Dr. Schrader has himself observed that the conception of the year in the primeval period was formed by combining the conceptions of the seasons † If so, it would not be difficult, even for these primitive Aryans, to perc ive that the period of twelve full moons fell short of their seasonal year by twelve days. Dr. Schrader again forgets he fact that it is more convenient, and hence easier and more natural, to make the year begin with a particular season or a fixed position of the sun in the heavens, than to have an ever-varying measure of time like the lunar year. Lewis, in his Historical Survey of the Astronomy of the Ancients, quotes Geminus to shew that " the system pursued by the ancient Greeks was to determine their months by he moon and their years by the sun,"I and

this appears to me to have been the system in force in the Indo-Germanic, or at any rate in the primitive Vedic period. There is no other conclusion that we can fairly draw from the facts and passages aored above. 
There is, however, a further question, as to whether the solar year, with reference to which these corrections were made, was tropical or sidereal. It is true that the great object of the caleader was to ascertain the proper time of the seasons. But the change in the seasons consequent upon the precession of the equinoxes is so exceedingly minute as to become appreciable only after hundreds of years, and it is more probable than not that it must have escaped the notice of the early observers of the heavens, whose only method of determining the position of the sun in the ecliptic was to observe every morning the sixed stars nearest that luminary.\* Under such a system the year would naturally be said to be complete when the sun returned to the same fixed star, Prof. Whitney has pointed out that the same system is followed in the Sürya Siddhanta, though the motion of the equinoxes was then discovered.t It is, therefore, natural to presume that the early Vedic priests were igaorant of the motion of the equinoxes. No early work makes any mention of or refers to it either expressly or otherwise ; and the solar year mentioned in

the Vedic works must, therefore, be considered as sidereal and not tropical. This would necessitate a change in the beginning of the year, every two thousand years or so, to make it correspond with the cycle of natural seasons, and the fact that such changes were introduced twice or thrice is a further proof of the old year being a sidereal one." The difference between the sidereal and the tropical year is 20'4 minutes, which causes the seasons to fall back nearly one lunar month in about every two thousand years, if the sidereal solar year be taken as the staadard of measure ment. When these changes and corrections came to be noticed for the first time, they must have created a great surprise, and it was not till after one or two adjustments on this account were made that their true reason, the motion of the equinoxes, could have been discovered. Garga tells us that if the sun were to turn to the north without reaching Dhanishtha,t it foretold great calamity, and I am disposed to put a similar interpretation upon the story of Prajapati alias Yajoa alias the year, who, contrary to all expectations, moved backwards to his daughter Rohiṇi.I But as I wish to examine the tradition more fully hereafter, it is not neces sary to dilate on the point here. My object at present is to show that the Vedic solar year was sidereal and dot tropical, and what has been said above is, I believe 
\* The Krittikās once bcaded the list of the Nakṣatras, which now begins with Ashvini. Other changes are discussed in the following chapters of this work.

sufficient to justify such a presumption, at least for the present, though it may afterwards be either retained or discarded, according as it tallies or jars with other facts. 
Opinions differ as to whether the lunar month began with the full or the new moon,\* and whether the original number of Nakṣatras was 27 or 28. † But I pass over these and similar other points as not very relevant to my purpose, and take up next the question of the commencement of the year. I have already stated that the sacrifice and the year were treated as synonymous in old days, and we may, therefore, naturally expect to fiod that the beginuing of the one was also the begioning of the other. The Vedānga Jyotisha makes the year commence with the winter solstice, and there are passages, in the Shrauta Sutras which lay down that the annual sacrifices like gavam-ayana, should be begun at the same time. I A tradition has also been recorded by Jaimini and others that all Deva ceremonies should be performedṣ only during the Uttarayaṇa ; and the Uttaraya a, according to the several Jyotisha works.ll is the period of the year from the winter to the summer solstice,

that is, from the time when the sun turns towards the north till it returns towards the south. This leads one to suppose that the winter solstice was the beginning of the year and also of the Uttarūyaṇa at the time when the annual sacrifices were established, and therefore in the old Vedic daya But a closer consideration of the ceremonies performed in the yearly satras will show that the wiater solstice could not have been the original beginning of these satras. The middle day of the annual satra is called the Viṣūvan day, and it is expressly stated that this central day divides the satra into two equal halves in the same way as the Vishūvào or the equinoctial day divides the year. The satra was thus the imitation of the year in every respect, and originally it must have corresponded exactly with the course of the year. Now, as Diṣivān literally means the time when day and night are of equal length, if we suppose the year to have at the time commenced with the winter solstice, the Vishûvān or the equinoctial day could never have been its central day, and the middle day of the satra would correspond, not with the equinoctial, as it should, but with the summer scistice. It might be urged that Vishivan as referring to the salra should be supposed to be used in a secondary sense. But this does not solve the difficulty. It presupposes that Vishuvān must have been used at one time in the primary sense (i. e., denoting the time when day and night are equal), and if in its primary sepse it was not used with reference to the satra, it must have been so used at least with reference to the year. But if Vishilvin was thus the central day of the year, the year must have once commenced with the equinoxes. The word

uttarayana is again susceptible of iwo interpretations. It may mean "turning towards the north from the southernmost point," or it may indicate “the passage of the sun into the northern hemisphere, i. c., to the north of the equator." If we adopt the first meaning, the Uttarayaya and the year must be held to commence from the winter solstice, while if the second interpretation be correct, the Uttarayana and the year must have once commenced with the vernal equinox. The facts, that the central day of the annual salra was called viṣuvān, that Vasanta or spring was considered to be the first of the seasons.\* and that the agravaneṣtis or the half-yearly sacrifices were required to be performed every Vasanta (spring) and śarad (autumn) † clearly shew that the second of the two interpretations given above is more likely to be the older one. Let us, however, examine the point more fully. 
The only passages where uttariyana is mentioned in the Vedic works are those wherein the white and the black paths for the souls of the deceased, the Devayāna and the Pitriyana, are described. The words devayana and pitriyana occur several times in the r̥gveda. Agni is said to know both these; while in the Vajasaneyi Sannitā 19. 47, these are said to be the two paths open to mortals. In the r̥gveda 1. 18, 1, the path of the god of Death is said to be the reverse of dezayona, and in the r̥gveda x. 98. 11, Agoi is said to know devayana by seasons. There is, however,

Before the idea was recorded in these works it must undoubtedly have received considerable additions, but nevertheless the original sense cannot be supposed to have been completely lost in these later additions. It is therefore extremely important to see how these two paths are described in the Brahmanas and Upanishads. Břih. vi., 2, 15 and Chh, iv. 15.5 state that "flame, day, the increasing moon, the six months when the sun is towards the north, the devaloka (Chh. derapatha) or the abode (Chh. patha) of gods, &c.," t is the way never to return; while "smoke, night, the decreasing moon, and the six months when the sun is towards the south, the pitriluka or the abode of Pitris" is the reverse. In the Bhagavad Gita viji. 24, 25 we find the same sentiments in modern phraseology, and the question is, what is meant by the phrase " the six inonths when the sun is towards the north." or, as Yā ika and the Gitả have it, “the six months of the

Ullarayana." Almost all the commentators have interpreted the expression to mean the six months from the winter to the summer solstice. Bat notwithstanding their high authority it will be found that their interpretation, though in consonance with the later astronomical views, is directly opposed to the passages in the Vedic works. In the Taittirīya Saphila vi. 5. 3, we are told “the sun, therefore, goes by the south for six months and six by the north" But this does not help us in ascertaining the correct meaning of the phrase "by the north." As it stands it may mean either the solstitial or the equinoctial six months. We must therefore look for another passage, and this we find in the Shatapatha Brahmana (ii. 1. 3, 1-3), where in describing the Iwo aforesaid paths it lays down in distinct terms that Vasanta, Grishma and Varsha are the seasons of the Devas; śarad, Hemanta and Shishira those of the Pilris ; the in creasing fortoight is of the Devas; the decreasing one of the Pitris : the day is of the Devas; the night of the Pitsis : again the first part of the day is of the Deva ; the latter of the Piipis............ When he (the sun) turns to the north, he is amongst the Devas and protects them; when he Luros to the south he is amongst the Pitris and protects them."+ 
\*Shankaracharya is not explicit ; yet his reference to the death of Bhisbma shows that he takes the same view. Anandgiri on Prashnopanishad i. 9, says Furnitu re I

SACRIFICE alias THE YEAR. 
This removes all doubts as to what we are to understand by devayana, devapātha, or devaluka and uttarayana as con nected with it. The Brihadāranyaka Upanishad is a part of the Shatapatha Brahmaña, and we shall not be violating any rule of interpretation if we interpret the passage in the one in the light of a similar passage in the other. Now if Va. santa (spring), Grishma (summer) and Varshā (rains) were the seasons of the Devas and the sun moved amongst the Devas when he turned to the north, it is impossible to maia. tain that the Devayāna or the Uttarayaṇa evet commenced with the winter solstice, for in neither hemisphere the winter solstice marks the beginning of spring, the first of the Deva seasons. The seasons in Central Asia and lodia differ. Thus the rains in India commence about or after the summer solstice, while in the plains of Asia the season occurs about the autumpal equipox. But in neither case Vasanta (spring) commences with the winter solstice or Varshā (rains) ends at the summer solstice. We must therefore hold that Devayāna in those days was understood to extend over the six months of the year, which comprised the three seasons of spring, summer, and raius, 1. t., from the verpal to the autumnal equinox, when the sun was in the northern hemisphere or to the north of the equator. This shows further that the oldest order of seasons did not place Varshā (rains) at the summer solstice, when the chief Indian monsoon commences; but at the autumnal equinox. The winter solstice, according to this order, falls in the middle of Hemanta. In the modern astronomical works, the winter solstice is, however, placed at the end and not in the middle of Hemanta, while the verbal equinox is said to fall in the middle of Vasanta. When the Vedic Aryas became
settled in India, such a change in the old order of seasons was necessary to make them correspond with the real aspect of nature. But it is difficult to determine exactly when this change was made. The old order of seasons given in the passage above quoted, however, clearly states that Vasanta in old days commenced with the vernal equinox. We can now understand why Vasanta has been spoken of as the first season and why the Nakṣatras have been divided into two groups called the Deva Nakṣatras and the Yama Nakṣatrast I am aware of the theory which attempts to explain away the passages above cited as metaphorical to avoid the appearance of superstition.i But the method is neither sound nor necessary. The path of the Devas and the path of the Pitsis are several times referred to in the r̥gveda, and though we might suppose the Brahmavādins to have developed the two ideas to their ut most extent, it cannot be denied that the original idea is an old one, suggested by the passage of the sun in the northern aud southern hemispheres. 
In the absence of anything to the contrary we might therefore take it as established that in the early Vedic days the year began when the sun was in the vernal equipox ; and as the sun then passed from the south to the north of the equator it was also the commencement of his northern passage.

the year, and the latter half of the year was named the Pitsi yana or what we would now call the Dakshiṇayana. It is difficult to definitely ascertain the time when the commence ment of the year was changed from the vernal equinox to the winter solstice. But the change must have been in. troduced long before the vernal equinox was in the Kșit tikäs, and when this change was made uttaniyang must have gradually come to denote the first half of the new year, 1. c., the period from the winter to the summer solstice, especially as the word itself was capable of being uader stood in the sense of "turging towards the north from the southernmost point," I am of opinion, however, that devayana and pitriyana, or devaloka and pitsiloka were the only terms used in the oldest times. It is a natural ia. ference from the fact that the word uttarayana, as such, does not occur in the r̥gveda. The fact, that Vishûvān was the central day of the yearly satra, further shows that the sacrificial system was coeval with the division of the year into the paths of Devas and Pitsis. After a certain period the beginning of the year was changed to the winter solstice, and it was sometime after this change was made that the words uttarayana and dakshinayana came to be used to denote the solstitial divisions of the year. But devayana and pitsiyīna could not be at once divested of the ideas which had already become associated with them. Thus while new feasts and sacrifices came to be regulated according to uttarayana and dakshinayana, devayana and pitriyûna with all the associated ideas continued to exist by the side of the new system, until they became either gradually assimilated with the new system or the priests reconciled the new and the old systems by allowing option
to individuals to follow whichever they decmed best. We must therefore take great care not to allow the idea of witarayana, as we now understand it, to obscure our vision in interpreting the early Vedic traditions, and that too much care can never be taken is evident from the fact that even so acute an astronomer as Bhaskaracharya was at a loss to correctly understand the tradition that the Uttarayana was the day of the Devas. In his Siddhanta Shiromani he raises the question how the Uttarayana, as it was generally understood in his day, could be the day of the Devas. He admits that the celestial beings on Meru at the North Pole bchold the sun (during all the six months) when he is in the northern hemisphere (vii. 9) and Chese six months may therefore be properly called their day. But the word \*ttarayana was then used to denote the period of six months from the winter to the summer solstice; and Bhaskaracharya was unable to understand how such an Uttarayana could be called the day of the Devas by the writers of the astronomical Saṁhitās. If the sun is visible to the Gods at Meru from the verbal equinox to the summer solstice, its passage back to the autumnal equinox lies through the same latitudes and in that passage, i. e., during three months after the summer solstice, the sun must, says Bhaskarichirya, be visible to the Gods. But according to the saṁhitā-writers the day of the Devas ended with the Uttarayana, that is, as Bhaskara understood 
\* In the Surya Siddhanta xii, 67 it is said that " At Meru Gods behold the sun, after but a single rising, during the hall of his revolution beginging with Aries;” while in xiv, 9, the Uttarayana is said to commence " from the sun's entrance into Capricora." The author, however, has not noticed the tradition that the Uttariyana is the day of the Devas and the apparent inconsistency Arisiog therefrom. Perhaps he understood the tradition in its truc sense.

the wurd, at the summer solstice. How is this conflict to be reconciled ? Bhaskaracharya could give do satisfactory solution of the difficulty, and asks his readers lo reconcile the conflicting statements on the supposition that the doctrine may be regarded as referring to "judicial astrology and the fruits it foretells."\* Had Bhaskaracharya however known that the word uttarliyana was sometimes used for devayana to denote the passage of the sun from the veraal to the autumnal equinox, I am sure, he would not have asked us to be satisfied with the lame explanation that the doctrine of the saṁhitā-writers need not be mathematically correct as it refers exclusively lo judicial astroligy. It is difficult to say whether the ancient Aryan ever lived so near the north pole as to be aware of the existence of a day extending over at least two or three if not six months of the year. But the idea that the day of the Devas commences when the sun passes to the north of the equa' or appears to be an old one. In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇat iii. 9. 22. 1. 
\*The original verses are as follows: 
दिनं सुराणामयनं यदुत्तरं निशेतरस्साहितिकः प्रकीर्तिनम् । दिनोन्मुखेऽ दिनमेव तन्मतं निशा तथा ताफल कातनाय तत् ॥ द्वन्द्वातमारोहति यः क्रमेण तोव वृत्तरवरोहतीन: ।

gó ai garIHE: I Thart: 1 It is however extremely hazardous to pase any theory upon this. Traditions like th:se have been ciled as indicating the fact the North Pole was inhabited in old days! Similar other traditions are said to i dicate the existence of . pre glacial period. Is it not more probabl: to suppose that when utturayana and dal:shiniiyana came to be first dis inguished, they were respectively named day' and 'night with a quuliiging word to mark their special nature? The history of languages shews that when people come across new ideas they try t.) name th.n in old woris, The Uttaravana and the Dakshinayana may have been thus conceived as God's day and night. See infra. Chap. V. 
we are told that the year is but a day of the Devas and even Herodotus (4CC B. C.) mentions a people who sleep during the six months of the year. If the tradition is, therefore, as old as it is represented to be, it is impossible to reconcile it with the later meaning of uttarayana as commecing from the winter solstice and this would then furpish an additional ground to hold that in early times the Uttarayana began with the vernal equinox as stated in the Shalapatha Brāhmaṇa. 
I have stated above that when the commencement of the year was altered from the vernal equinox to the winter solstice, uttarayana either lost its older meaning or was rather used to denote the solstitial division of the year. But this is not the only consequence of that change. With the year the beginning of the annual satras was also gradually transferred to the winter solstice and the change was complete when the Taittirīya Saṁhitā was compiled. In fact had it not been for the passage in the Shatapatha Brahmana it would have been impossible to produce any direct evidence of the older practice. When the beginning of the satra was thus changed, the Vishûvān day must have gradually lost its primary meaping and come to denote simply the central day of the yearly satra. 
The old practice was not however completely forgotten and for the purpose of the Nakṣatra-sacrifices the vernal equinox was still taked as the starting point. Thus it is that Garga tells us that "of all the Nakṣatras the Krittikās are said to be the first for sacrificial purposes and Shravishtha for (civil) enumeration." But even this distinction

appears to have been eventually lost sight of by the later writers and all references to uttarayana were under stood to be made solely to the six months from the winter to the summer solstice, an error from which even Bhaska rāchārya did not escape, though he perceived the absurdity caused by it in some cases. At the present day we on the southern side of the Narmadā begin the year at the vernal equinox for all civil purposes, but still all the religious ceremonies prescribed to be performed in the Uttarayaṇa, are performed during the Ullarayana beginning with the winter solstice, a position quite the reverse of that described by Garga. When we at the present day have been thus using the system of a double year-beginning, we need not be surprised if the ancient Aryas, after shifting the commencement of the year to the winter solstice, managed to keep up the old and the new system together by assigning the different beginnings of the year to different purposes as indicated by Garga. It was the only alternative possible if nothing old was to be enlirely given up.
