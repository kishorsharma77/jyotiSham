In the last chapter I have quoted an observation of Plutarch that the Greeks gave their own came to the constellation of Orion, and have there discussed some Vedic legends which corroborate Plutarch's remarks and indicate that the vernal equiaox was in Orion at that time. In the present chapter I mean to examine other legends which go to shew that the constellation of Orion was known and figured before the Greeks, the Parsis, and the Indians separated from their common home, and that the legends or the traditions so preserved, and perhaps the name of the cous lellation, can be naturally and easily explained only on the supposilion that the vernal cquinox was then near the asterism of Mrigashiras. 
I have already shown that Agrahāyni if not Agrahayana, can be traced back to Pāṇini's Lime, as the name of a Naksbalra, and that it is a mistake to derive it from the Dame of the full-moon day. We have now to see if we can 
cunt for both the and āgrayana he old Parsi
trace back the word still further. The word hayana does aot occur in the Rigveda, and it may be doubted if the game Agrahayani was in use in the old Vedic days. Hayana is, however, used in the Atharva Veda (viii. 2. 21 ; xi. 6. 17) and in the Brahmanas; and may be compared with Lead Zayana neaning wiater. Pāṇini (iii. 1. 148) derives hayana from Ad to go or abandon, after the analogy of gāyana and gives two meanings, vix, the grain 'vrihi'' and 'lime.' Whether we accept this derivation or not, it is at any rale clear that the word was used in Panini's days, to denote a division of time and a kind of grain, and I think we can better account for both these meanings of húyana by connecting the word with ayana and Agrayana or the half yearly sacrifices. Dr. Geiger, speaking of the old Parsi calcndar observes that “probably the half-year was more employed in civil life than the complete year," Now whether the observation be entirely correct or not, we can, I think at any rate, assume that the division of the year into two equal halves is an old one. I have already discussed the (wo-fold division of the year into Devayana and Atriyana and its coincidence with the passage of the sua to the north and the south of the equator. Ayana in the sense of such a division thus appears to be an old word and by prefixing a to it we may easily get hayana subsequently changed into hayana like the words in the Prajaadi list, wherein this word was not included as it was derived by Panini in a different way. The insertion and omission of h when

followed by a vowel at the begianing of a word is not un. common even in these days, and there is nothing extra. ordinary if we derive hayana from ayana, Now by a natural process when we have two forms of a word or two derivatives of the same root they gradually come to be utilised for specific purposes, and so acquire distinct meanings Sanskrit lexicographers class such words under 
Yogaridha, meaning thereby that etymology and cooven. tion have each a share in determining their deaotation. Hayana might thus come to exclusively depole a complete year, while ayan. contiaued to donole a half-year as as before.t When ayana thus became hayana, Agrayana, which all lexicologists derive from agra + ayana, I would be changed into agra + hayana - Agrahiyana ; aod when hayana was changed to hayana in a manner analogous to the words 10 the Prajnadi list (Paq. v. 4. 38) as stated above, Agrahayana would be altered into Agrahayana. We can thus account for the double forms-hayana and hầyana, Agrahayana and Agrahîyana which we fiod given in Böhtlingk and Roth's and other lexicons. while if we accept Paṇini's derivation, 
\* Cf. The derivation of the word history' from 'istory' in Max Müller's Lectures on the Science of Language, Vol. Il., p. 329. 
Zend Zayano, denoting wiater, probably preserves an older incaning, when hayana was used to denote the second of the two seasons (summer had winter) into which Dr. Schrader believes that the year was primevally divided. Some of the syaonyms for the year in Sanskrit originally deaoted particular season, E. Jó, Vanha, Sharad. Sama and Hayana may be similarly suppoyed to bave been derived from the pames of the hall.year or ayanda 
• This derivation would give us Agravana instead of Agrayana and antine grammarians obtain the second form from the frst by the interobange of the initial vowel with the following long a.
hayana will have to be cither thrown out as incorrect or derived otherwise. ln Amara ii. 8. 59, hayann occurs as a different reading for dayana in the sense of a vehicle and Bhānu Dikshita derives it from hay to go; but we might as well ask if hay, ay, and i, all meaning to go, are not the different forms of the same root. As far as the form of the word is concerned we may therefore derive hayana from hayana and the latter again from ayana and similarly Agrahāyana from Agrahayana and this again from Agrayana 
I may, however, remark that the process which appears so simple according to the modern philological rules, was not recognized by the native grammarians. There are good many words in Sanskrit which can be thus easily derived on the principle of the insertion and omission of h. Thus we have invakā and hinvakā both meaning the stars on the top of Mrigashiras, and atta and hatta denoting a marketplace. But Dative grammarians, including Pāṇini, would not derive the words from cach other, as we have done above in the case of ayana and hayana, Their method is to give two different roots for the two words, thus we have two Vedic roots hinva and inva or hiv and iv, both meaning to go, lo please, the one giving us kinvaka and the other invaka. At and hat, an and han, ay and hay, i and hi are further instances of the principle adopted by the native grammarians in such cases. Really speaking this is not solving the difficulty, but only shifting it a stage backwards ; for if any explanation is pecessary to account for the double forms like ayana and hayana, it is equally required to explain why we should have the double roots like ay aod hay, both meaning to go. But it appears that the native grammarianad having traced 
VI.] ORION AND HIS BELT. 
133 
the words to their roots, did not push the matter further. With them ina is derived froin i to go, ayana from ay to go, hayana from hay to go, and hayana from na to go.\* Whether and how far we can dispease with some of these roots is an important philological question, but it is not necessary for us to discuss it here. It does not much affect the point under discussion whether hayana is derived from ayana, i. e., ay to go, or from hān to go as Pānipi has done. Elymologically both the words, ayana and hāyana, mean "going" and when both came to be used to denote a division of time, it is natural to suppose that they soon acquired special meanings. Thus while ayana continued to denote the half year; huyana, which was com paratively a later word, might have been exclusively used to denole the complete year, and as the beginniag of the first ayana was also the beginning of the year, A(a)grayana would be Daturally changed inlo A(a)graht(a)yana to express the beginning of the year. Whether we adopt Pāṇini's deriva tion or the principle of modern philology we thus arrive at the same result, and so far as our present inquiry is concerned we can therefore suppose that the various words, which may be represented by X (a)gra(@lyand, or A(agrihā(a)yaṇa, are all transformations or derivations of agru t ayana - 
A(a)grayana. 
\* This method sometimes fails, and native grammarians who are not now at liberty to coin new rools, have to resort to the Prishodaridi list. For example, we liave two forms ilvalā and hilvala as differcot readings for invata in Amara i. 3. 23. Of these ilvald can be derived from it, to sleep, though the root meaning is not suitable, but hālvalā cannot be even so derived and Tārānātha in bis VAcbaspatya would derive or rather obtaia the initial h by Pfishodaridi. Similarly cf. Fintāla = túl + Přisho.larji!
Now as regards the meaning it appears to me that ayana at first denoted nothing more than the passage of the sun. Gradually it meant a division of time regulated by such passage. The Agravana-sshtis thus appear to have originally meant the two half-yearly sacrifices performed on the first day of each ayana, which seems to be regarded somewhat like the new year's day at present. Gārgya Nārāyaṇa, in his commeotary op Ashvalayana's Shrauta Sülras (i. 2. 9. 1.) derives Agrayana from agra + ayana; but interprets it to mean a sacrifice which is followed by eating (ayana,) that is, which requires to be performed before the new harvest is used for domestic purposes. He thus takes ayana to mean eating, and as the Agrayaneshtis in later works like Manu (iv. 27) were described as “ New-harvest sacrifices," all commentators have adopted this explanation of the word. But it appears to me to be evidently of lauter origin and invested to account for the nature of the sacrifice when owing to the falling back of seasons the Agravaneṣtis came to be performed not at the beginning of each ayana as they should have been, but at wrong times. The necessity of such an explanation must have been still more keenly felt, when instead of two half yearly sacrifices, the Agrayanaiṣtis were performed thrice a year. Ashvalayana, it is true, gives only two, che in Vasanta and the other in Sharad, the old beginnings of the Devayana and the Pitsiyāna and the real commencement of the two ayanas But he has mentioned three kinds of grain that may be used, vrihi, shyamuka and yava (i. 2. 9. 1,) and bis commentator Gārgya Narayana observes that y'ava and skyamāka are to be used simultaneously in Slarad (i.2. 9. 13). It appears, however, that the fact, that three kiods of grain were sanctioned for use, soon gave rise to three

135 
Agrayana-ishtisone in Vasanta with vrihi ; the second in Varshā with shyamaka, and the third in Sharad with yava. But that it is a practice of later origin is evident from a passage in the Tailliriya Saphitā (v. 1.7.3) which states that "twice is grain cooked for the year," clearly meaning thereby that there were only two Agrayana-iṣtis in a year when the new harvest was first offered to gods. I am therefore of opinion that originally there were only two half-yearly sacri. fices at the commencement of each ayann, and as vrihi was used, on the occasion of the first of these ishtts, the word 
ayana or hayana naturally came to denote the grain so used, and that ayana in Agrayana originally meant not eating as the later writers have ima gined, but a half-year as the word usually denotes. This way of deriving and explaiping the word is not a new invention. For notwithstanding the fact thal Agrayana and Agrahayana are explained by Tārānāt ha as referring to the sacrifice of grain and eating, yet he derives Agrayana, a word of the same group, from agra + ayana and explains it to mean that “the Uttarayaħa was in its frcnt."\* Even dative scholars thus appear to be aware of the fact that Ägrayana could be or was derived from ayana meaning the Uttarāyaṇa. Indeed, we cannot otherwise account why the āgrayaneshtis were originally celebrated at the beginning of Vasanla yod the end of Varṣā as stated by Ashvaldyana. The Agrahayani of Amara is thus traceable to Āgrayani of the Vedic works; and perhaps it was the initial long vowel in the laller that might have been retained in the later form. 
It may, however, be asked if there is any evidence to show that Agrayana was used to dencte a star in the Vedic 
\* See Vāghaspatya s. v. Agrayana.

works. That Amara, and long before him Pāṇioi, understood Agrahayanî, if not Agrahîyana, to mean the Nakshatra of Mpigashiras is undoubted ; and I think we might fairly infer therefrom that the meaning given by these writers must have come down to them traditionally. Every ayana must begin with some Nakshatra, and it is quite natural to suppose that Agrayana must have gradually come to depote the star that rose with the first ayana. But I have not been able to find out a passage where Ägrayana is used in the Vedic works to expressly denote the constellation of Mrigashiras. I may, however, refer to the Taittiriya Sanhilā (vi. 4. 11. 1.) wherein the vessels (grahas) used for sacrificial purposes are mentioned as beginning with Agrayana and considering the fact that two other vessels are named, as the words themselves denote, after the planets Shukra and Manthin," we might suppose that Agrayana came to be included in the list, nol as the name of a deity, for it was not such a name, but as denoting, the star which commenced the year, or the half-year. The word graha which in the sacrificial literature denotes vessel has been used in later astronomical works to denote the planets, the number of which, including the sun and the moon, is fixed at nine, the same as the number of the vessels used for sacrificial purposes. It is not, therefore, improbable that Agraha yani or Agrahayana of the later writers was a transformation of Agravana, and that Mrigashiras, was so called in old times for sacrificial purposes. When the Agra. yaneṣtis lost their primary meaning, Agrayanı or Agraha.

yana naturally came to to be used more to denote the month when the sacrifice was performed than the Nakshatra at the beginning of the dyana, thus giving rise to the specu. lations previously discussed. But in whatever way we may explain the disappearance of Agrayana in the sense of Mrigashiras in the oldest Vedic works, the fact that in the days of Amara and long before him of Pāṇini Agrahayant was used to denote the constellation of Orion remains ugshaken, and we may safely ipfer therefrom that the mean ing given by them was a traditional one. 
We have already seen how legends gathered round the 4 antelope's head." It was the head of Prajapati wishing to violate his daughter, by which some understood the dawn, some the sky and some the star Aldebaran (Ait. Br. iii 33). Others built the story of Namuchi upon the same which placed Vritra, at the doors of hell; while a third class of legend-makers considered that the death of Prajapati was voluntary for the sacrificial purposes of the Devas. The follow ing summary of the classical traditions about the death of Orion, taken from Dr. Smith's smaller Classical Dictionary, will show how strikingly similar they are to the old Vedic legends. 
“The cause of Orion's death is related variously. "According to some, Orion was carried off by Eos (Aurora), "who had fallen in love with him ; but as this was dis. "pleasing to the gods, Artemis killed him with an arrow "in Ortygia. According to others, he was beloved by "Artemis and Apollo † indignant at his sister's affection "for him, asserted that she was unable to hit with her 
• llomer Od. v. 121. 4. See Gladstone's Time and Place of Homer, p. 214. 
+ Ov, Fast v, 537.
"arrow a distant point which he showed her in the sea. “She thereupon took aim, the arrow hit its mark, but the "mark was the head of Orion, who was swimming in the "sea. A third account, which Horace follows, states that he "offered violence 10 Artemis, and was killed by the god " dess with one of her arrows." 
Thus love, arrow and decapitation which are the three principal elements in the Vedic legends, are all present in these traditions. There is another story which says that Orion was stung to death by a scorpion ; but this is evidently intended to represent the fact that the constella tion of Orion sets when that of Scorpion rises in the east, and is therefore of later origin when the zodiacal signs were adopted by the Greeks. 
There are other traditions which point out the position of Orion in the course of the year. The cosmical setting of the constellation was believed to be an indication of stormy weather and the constellation was called imbrifer or acquosus in the same way as the Shva in the Vedas is said to com mence the year, while Shunasirau are invoked along with Parjanya for rain. The German traditions are, however, more specific, and I take the following abstract of the same by Prof. Kuhn communicated to the late Dr. Rajendralāl Mitra and published by the latter in his " Indo-Aryans," Vol. II., pp. 300-302 : 
"Both in our ancient and modero popular traditions, there is universally spoken of the Wild Hunter, who some times appears under the name of Wodan or Goden, and was, in heathenish times, the supreme god of the ancicot German nations. This god coincides, both in character and shape with the ancient Rudra of the Vedas (vide p. 99). 
VI.] 
ORION AND HIS BELT. 
139 
Now there is a class of traditions in which this ancient God is said to hunt a stag and shoot at it, just as Rudra in the Brāhmaṇas is represented as shooling at the fishya and rohit. The stag in German mythology, is the animal of the god Freyr, who, like Prajapati, is a god of the sun, of ferti. lity, &c., so that the shot at thal slag is to be compared with Rudra's shooting at the rishya= Prajapati, I have further endeavoured to show that some indications exist in the mediaval penitentials of Germany and England, which give us to understand that at the close of the old year and at the beginning of the new one ( we call that time “ die zwölften" or th: twelve days, dvûdashûhu of the Indians ) there were mummeries performed by the country people, in which two persons seem to have been the principal per formers, the one of whom was disguised as a stag while the other was disguised as a hind. Both represented a scene, which must have greatly interested and amused the people, but very much offended the clergy, by its sordid and hideous character; and from all the indications which are given in the text, communicated by me (pp 108.180), we may safely suppose that the chief contents of this representation was the connection of a stag and a hind (or of an old woman ), which was accompanied by the singing of unchaste songs. From English customs at the New Year's Day, we may also infer that the hunter's shooting at this pair was even a few centuries ago, nay, is even now, not quite forgotten. Now as the time of the "twelve days" was with our ances tors the holiest of the whole year, and the gods were believed to descend at that time from heaven and to visit the abodes of men, we may firmly believe that this repre sentation also was a scene of the life of the Gods. I hope
to have thus proved that the Brahmanical and the German traditions are almost fully equal, and I have finally attempted Lo lay open the idea from which the ancient myth proceeded. According to my explanations, our common Indo-European ancestors believed that the sun and the day-light (which was, so 10 say, personifed under the image of various animals, as a cow or bull, a horse, a boar, a stag), was every day killed in the evening and yet re-appeared almost unhurt, the next morning. Yet a decay of his power was clearly visible in the time from midsummer to midwinter, in which latter lime, in the more northern regions he almost wholly disappears, and in northern Germany, during the time of the twelve days, is seldom to be seen, the heavens being then usually covered all over with clouds. I have therefore supposed, it was formerly believed that the sun was then completely destroyed by a God, who was both a God of night and winter as also of storm, Rudra - Wodan. The relics of the destroyed sun, they seem to have recognised in the brightest constellations of the winter months, December and Jaouary, that is, in Orion and the surrounding stars. But when they saw that they had been deceived and the sun re appeared the myth gained the further development of the seed of Prajapati, from the rempants of which a new Aditya as well as all bright and shiniog Gads were produced. I have further shown that both Greek astronomy and German tradition proved to be in an intimate relation with the Brahmanical tradition ; for the former shows us, in almost the same place of the celestial sphere, a gigantic hunter (Msigavyadha, Sirius; Orion, the hunter Mrigashiras) ; whilst the latter has not yet forgotten that Saint Hubertus, the stag-killer, who is nothing out a

representative of the God Wodan, who had, like Rudra, the power of healing all diseases (the bhiṣaktama of the Vedas) and particularly possessed cures for mad dogs which not only were his favourite companions, but were also in near connection with the hottest season of the year, when the declisiog of the sun begins, the so-called dog-days." 
Here is an equally striking coincidence between the German and the Vedic traditions. The mummeries were performed "at the close of the old year and at the beginning of the new one," and the stag and the hunter had therefore something to do with it. Prof. Kuhn's explanation does not clear up this point satisfactorily, nor does it give any reason why the festivals were celebrated only during the twelve days preceding the new year. As regards the decay of the sun's power it must have been observable during the whole season acd does not therefore in any way account for the selection of 12 particular days. As for the dvādashaha of the Indians, it is the period during which a person consecrates himself for a yearly sacrifice and so must naturally precede the commencement of the new year when the annual sacrifice commences, and I have previcusly shewn that it represents the difference between the lunar and the solar years ; in other words, they were what we may now call the intercalary days added at the end of each year to keep the concurrence of the lunar and the solar measures of time. The German traditions therefore can be better accounted for, if we suppose that they are the reminiscences of a time when the stag and the hunter actually commenced the year. This also explains why the dog.days were considered so inportant. When Sirius or the dog-star rose with the sun at the beginning of the year, the dog-days, or rather the days when the dog was not visible, were
the new.year's days, and as such they were naturally invested with an importance which they never lost. I have already alluded to the passage in the Rigveda which states that the dog awakened the ķibhus, or the gods of the seasons, at the end of the year, and this appears to me to be the origin of what are still known as dog-days in the western countries, Owing to the precession of the equinoxes and by neglecting to maintain the correspondence of the seasons the days now fall during a period different from the one they did of old, but such differences we find in all cases where ancient rites or festivals are preserved. The feast of the manes, which the Parsis and the Hindus seem to have commenced to gether when the summer solstice occurred in the month of Bhadrapada, now no longer coincides with the summer sol. stice ; but for that reason we cannot say that it might not have occured originally at the summer solstice, especially when the later supposition is supported by other reliable evidence, and gives a better origin of the festival. I am not therefore disposed to accept Prof. Kuhn's explanation as salis. factory, and am of opinion that the German traditions are the reminiscences of a time when the veroal equinox was in Orion, the hunter. We cannot otherwise account why the mummeries and festivals should have been celebrated during the twelve days at the end of the old and the beginning of the new year. 
It will, I think, be evident from this that the Greeks and Germans have preserved the memory of the days when the year commenced with the vernal equinox in Orion. I have previously shown that the Parsi primitive calendar, as fixed by Dr. Geiger, poiots to the same conclusion. The Parsis, the Greeks, the Germans and the Indiaas therefore appear to have separated after these traditions were formed and after Orion was figured, and recognised as the Agrayana

constellation. I do do think that any more traditional coincidences are necessary to establish the Aryan origin of the constellation of Orion, as well as its position at the ver nal equinox io old days. I shall, however, give one more coincidence which on account of its peculiar nalure is alike interesting and important. 
lo the Greek mythology Orion, after his death as above described, was placed among stars, " where he appears as a giant with a girdle, sword, a lion's skin, and a club."\* Now, if as remarked by Plutarch, Orion is an original Greek name, we should find some traces of these various adjuncts of Orion or at least some of them in the old Iranian and Indian works. Do we so find them ? I think we do, only if we look for them with a little more attention and care, for the transformation is more specific and peculiarly out of the way in this case. In the Vedic works Soma is said to be the presiding deity of the asterism of Mrigashiras. Soma is Haoma with the Parsis. The 26th verse in the Haoma Yasht is as follows: 
Frā te Mazdao barat paurvanim aivyaonghanem Steher-paesanghem mainyu-tāstem vanghuhim-daenim 
Mazdayasnim. which has been thus rendered by Mr. Mills in his transla tion of the Zend Avesta, Part III., in the Sacred Books of the East Series (P. 238 ) :-" Forth has Mazda borne to thee, the star-bespangled girdle, the spirit-made, the ancient one, the Mazda-Yasnian Faith." Dr. Haug takes paurvanim in the original to mean " leading the paurvas," which latter he believes to be the Persian name for the Pleiades, which is variously written parú, parvah, parvin and parviz.t This keep-sighted suggestion of Dr. Haug has been pronounced 
SeeSmith's Dictionary of Classical Mythology, † Dr. Haug's Essays on the Parsis, p. 182.
by Mr. Mills as "doubtful, and refuted by Vistasp Yasht 29, where Darmesteter renders a word probably akin as "the many.'" But excepting this difference of opinion all agree in holding this Yasht to be an ancient one, "a repro duction of an Aryan original," and that the verse above given contains a description of the belt of Orion. Orion is Haoma, the Soma of the Indians which is its presiding deity in the Vedic works, and the above verse states that God has given a natural star-studded girdle to Haoma. This girdle is, therefore, no other than the belt of Orion. The verse in the Haoma Yashl, however suggests more than it denotes. Both Haug and Mills have used the word 
girdle in the translation. But whether we use "girdle' or belt,' it hardly conveys the idea of the original arvyaon ghanen. It is a striking instance of how in translations we sometimes lose the force of the original. Aivyaonghana is a Zend word for the kusti, or the sacied thread of the Parsis, which they wear round their waist. The girdle' or the 'belt' of Orion is thus said to be his kusti, and though we may have no more traces of the belt' or the \* club' of Orion in the Parsi scriptures, the above verse at once directs our attention to the place where we may expect to find the traces of Orion's belt in the Indian works, I have before pointed out that Orion or Mạigashiras is called Prajapati in the Vedic works, otherwise called Yajna. A belt or girdle or a piece of cloth round the waist of Orion or Yajna will therefore be naturally named after him as yajno pavita, the upavite, or the cloth of Yajna. The Lerm, how ever, now deuotes the sacred thread of the Brahmaus, and it Inay naturally be asked whether it owes its character, if aot

146 
the origin, to the belt of Orion. I think it does on the following grounds. 
The word yajnopavita is derived by all native scholars from yajna + upavita; but there is a difference of opinion as to whether we should understand the compound to mean an 
upavita for yajna,' i, e., for sacrificial purposes, or, whether it is the 'upavita of yajna.' The former is not incorrect, but authority is in favour of the latter. Thus the Prayoga-writers quote a smțili to the effect that "the High Soul is termed yajna by the hotạis\*; this is his upavita; therefore, it is yajno. pavita." A mantra, which is recited on the occasion of wear ing the sacred thread means, "I bind you with the upavita of jajna;"+ while the first half of the general formula with which a Brāhman always puts on his sacred thread is as follows: 
यज्ञोपवीतं परमं पवित्रम् प्रजापतेर्यत्सहजं पुरस्तात् । 
The mantra is not to be found in any of the existing Sanhitas, but is given in the Brahmopanishad and by Baudhayana. This verse is strikingly similar to the verse quoted above from the Haoma Yasht. It says, "yajnopavita is high avd sacred; it was born with Prajapati, of old." The word purastat corresponds with paurvanim in the Avesta verse and thus decides the question raised by Dr. Haug, while 
\* पारिजात स्मृतिसारे: 
यशाख्यः परमात्मा य उच्यते चैव होमिः। 
उपर्वातं यतोस्येदं तस्मायज्ञोपवीतकम् ॥ . † See Taranatha's Väshaspatya 8. v. upavita ; and Saakbyd yava Grihyasutra, ii, 2.3, where the mantra is given as follows:--- asgaiara I 01FT TasTecarga UTIH I In the Paraskara Grihyastura, ii, 2. 11, both these mantras, ostala ora & C., and

sahaja,\* born with the limbs of Prajapati, conveys the same meaning as main u-tāstem. The coincidence between these verses cannot be accidental, and it appears to me that the sacred thread must be derived from the belt of Orion. Upavita, from ve to weave, literally means a piece of cloth and not a thread.t It appears, therefore, that a cloth worn round the waist was the primitive form of yajnopavita, and that the idea of sacredness was introduced by the theory that it was to be a symbolic representation of Prajapati's waist-cloth or belt. In the Taittiriya Sanhita (ii. 5. 11. 1.) nivita, prachināvita aad upavita, three words which at present denote the position of the sacred thread on the body of a Brāhman, are defined, but the Mimānsakast understand them to apply not to the sacred thread, as we now wear it, but to a piece of cloth or dear-skin, which everyone must use at the time of sacrificing. It appears, therefore, that in the oldest times the Brahamans wore a piece of cloth or deer-skin and not a thread. This conclusion is further strengthened by the fact, that according to the ritual given in the Sutras, no sacred thread is mentioned in the description of the ceremony of Upanayana ; $ while the investiture with the

thread is looked upon at present as the principal part of that ceremony. We have still retained a memory of this old practice in the performance of obsequies and at the time of performing sacrifices, when a piece of cloth is worn in addition to the sacred thread. Devala" says that out of the three sacred threads to be worn, one is a substitute for the upper garment, thus clearly indicating what the old practice was, But this is not the place to go into these details. It is enough for our purpose to notice that yajnopavila originally, meant a piece of cloth, and that in the times of the smriti writers, it came to be symbolically represented by the sacred thread, thrice twisted and thrice folded. There is, however, another difficulty which must be here noticed. The Parsis wear their sacred thread round the waist, while the Brahmans usually wear it over the left shoulder and across the body, leaving the right arm free (i e., upavita ). The Parsis may thus be said to wear their sacred thread after the manner of Orion ; but in the case of the Brahmans, it may be questioned if their manner of wearing the thread corresponds to the position of Orion's belt. From the passage in the Taittiriya Sanhitā referred to above, it will, however, be seen that nivita (and not upāvita), is the position of the thread there prescribed for all human actions, or, in other words, for doing all ordinary business of life. Nivita has been defined by all later writers to mean the position of the sacred thread passing around the neck, over both the shoulders and droppiog down in front. A reference to Kumārila Bhatta's Tansa Vārtika (iii. 4. 2.), will, however, show that nivita also meant "Lying round the waist," and Kumārila observes that "tying round the waist is the most convenient position for all kinds of

work."\* ānandagiri and Govindananda in their commenta ries on Shankara's Bhashya on the Brahmasútras (iii. 4. 19.), give the same explanation, from which it appears that the Brahmans, like the Parsis, once wore the thread around the waist, thus literally girding up their loins when they had to do any work. The sacred thread of the Parsis and the Brahmans thus seems to be a symbolical representation of Prajapati's girdle or Orion's belt in every respect. The various stages, by which the original piece of cloth round the waist dwindled into a thread, are interesting and instruc Live from a ceremonial point of view, but not being relevant to the present inquiry, I do not mention them here. 
As the passage is important as a record of now obsolete practice I give it bere in the original

As the practice has long since been obsolete, the verses have been much misunderstood by later writers. The author of the PIQUt does, however, clearly state that there are two ways of wearing the thread, Arst over the shoulder as described in the Taitt, Aro, ii, 1; and ( w in the origiaal) accond as given in the above texts of Katyayana and Devala.

Bul the sacred thread is not the only trace of Orion's dress that we have retained. A reference to the Upanayana ceremonial will show that we have preserved belt, staff, skin, and all. Every boy, who is the subject of this ceremony, has to wear a inekhald or grass cord round his waist, and we still put three knots to this cord just over the navel, as it were, to represent the three stars in the belt of Orion. In the Vājasaneyi Sanhita 4, 10, we are told that the knot of the mekhald, when it is worn for sacrificial purposes, is to be tied with the mantra, "you are the knot of Soma,"+ which Mahidhara explains as "a knot dear to Soma ;" but which remembering that we have a similar verse in the Haoma Yasht, may be naturally interpreted to mean the knot of Soma, the presiding deity over the constellation of Orion, Then every boy whose upauayana, or the thread ceremony as it is popularly understood, is performed, must carry with him a stick of the pilasha or the fig-tree and the same passage in the Vajasaneyi Sanhitā says that for sacrificial purposes the stick (danda) is to be taken in hand by the Mantra, “O wood ! be erect and protect me from sin till the eod of this vajna." Here again Mahîdhara interprets yajna to mean sacrifice for which the staff is taken up. 
\* In the Prayoga works we have (and we still do so)

But the explanation is unsuited to the frst case, vie., of one kaot, and I am inc'iaed to take it to be a later suggestion.

But I think here also we may trace a reference to Prajapati alias Yajna. The third accompaniment of a newly initiated boy is the deer-skin. Theoretically it is necessary that he should be fully clothed in a deer-skin, but practically we now attach a small piece of deer.skin to a silk thread and wear this thread along with the Yajnopavita. Mekhali, ajina, danda (the girdle, the skin and the staff) are thus the three distinguishing marks of a newly initiated boy; and what could they mean, except that the boy is made to assume the dress of Prajapati as far as possible. To become a Brahman is to imitate Prajapati, the first of the Brahmans. Prajapati assumed the form of a deer, so the boy is clothed in a deer-skin ; Pra japati has a girdle round his waist (the belt of Orion), so has the boy his mekhald with three knots over the navel; and lastly, Prajapati has a staff, and so the boy must have it too. \* 
\* Dr. Scbrader in his Preh. Ant, Ary. Peop., Part iv., Chap. viii., concludes that the primitive dress consisted of a piece of woolen or lioen cloth throwo round the shoulders like a mantle, and a girdle. The history of vajnopavíta, the way of weariog it as described in Taitt. Arn. ii. 1., and Orion's dress, as conceived by the Greeks, point to the same conclusion. I have already alluded to the dinoulty of explaining how uparita, which literally means a cloth, came to denote a thread. If yajnopavita be taken to have originally meant yajna and uparitu, and yajna be further supposed to have once denoted a girdle this difficulty is removed. Av, yasto Gk. zostos, Lith, justas, ineaning "girded" point to an original root jos, Av. yangh, from which Ok zonu, Av. aiv ydonghana may be derived (Sce Ficke' Jodo Germ. Wort ). If we suppose that the root appeared as yaj in Sanskrit apd derive yajna from it, like Gk, 2014, we may take yajna to meen a girdle and translate wulgaat omgor : (JALAL, Ups. 5.) by how can a Braman bé without a girdle and & cloth.?" If this suggestion de correct, then yajnopavita must be

Thus in their Upanayan ceremony the Brahmans have fully preserved the original characteristic of the dress of Praji pati or Orion. The Brahman batu (boy) does not, however, carry a sword as Orion is supposed to do, and the skin used by the boy is deer's and not lion's. I cannot account for the first of these differences except on the ground that it might be a later addition to the equipment of Orion, the hunter, But the second might be traced to a mistake similar to that committed in the case of the seven r̥kshas. The word Mriga in the Rigveda, means according to the Sayaṇa both a lion and a deer, and I have already referred to the doubts entertained by modern scholars as to the animal really denoted by it. Mrigājina is therefore likely to be mistaken for lions skin. There is thus an almost complete coinci dence of form between Orion as figured by the Greeks and the boy whose upanayana is recently performed, and who is thus made to dress after the mapper of Prajā pati. I do not mean to say that a piece of cloth was not worn round the waist before the constellation of Orion was so conceived ; on the contrary, it is more natural lo suppose that the ancient 
taken to have meant nothing more than a mantle and a girdle in primitive times and that the primitive people invested Orion with a dress similar to their own. When Orion came to be looked upon as a celestial representation of Prajapati, Orion's drese munt have attained the sacred character which we find preserved in the sacred thread of the Parsis and the Branians, 1, however, know of no passage in the Vedic literature where yajna is used in the sense of a girdle, and hence the above suggestion must be coosidered a very doubtful. But it may be here mentioned that in Marathi wo use the word jānve to denote the sacred thread. This word is evidently derived from Sk. yajna, Prakrita janno. Perhaps we bave retained onlyt he first word of the long compound yajnopavita.

people invested Orion with their own dress. But the coinci dence of details above given does, in my opinion, fully establish the fact that the sacred character of a batu's dress was derived from what the ancient priests conceived to be the dress of Prajapati. With these coincidences of details, still preserved, it is impossible to deny that the configuration of the constellation of Orion, is of Aryan origin and that the Hellenic, the Iranian and the Indian Aryas must have lived together when these traditions and legends were formed. 
And now it may be asked that if the Eastern and the Western legends and traditions of Orion are so strikingly similar, if not identical, if the dress and the form of the constellation are shewn to have been the same amongst the different sections of the Aryan race, and if the constellations at the feet and in front of Orion-Canis Major and Canis Minor, Kuon and Prokuon,\* Shvan and Prashvan, the Dog 
ndthe Foredogaare Aryan both in name and traditions ; in short, if the figure, the costume, the altendants and the history of Orion are already recognised as Aryan is it not highly probable that the name, Orion, should itself be a transformation or corruption of an ancient Aryan word ? Orion is an old Greek name. Homer in the fifth book of Odyssey speaks of the bold Orion and the traditional coin cidences, mentioned above, fully establish the probability of Plutarch's statement that the word is not borrowed from à Doa-Aryan source. Two of the three games, mentioned by Plutarch Cagis (Kuon) and Ursa (Arktos) have again been phonetically identified with Sanskrit shuan and sikṣas, and we may, therefore, legitimately expect to fiod Orion similarly traced back to an Aryan original. The task, how.

ever, is not so easy as it appears to be at the first sight. The Greek mythology does not give us any help in the solution of this question. It tells us that a hunier by name Orion was transformed after his death into this constellation which consequently come to be called after him. But this is surely no satisfactory explanation Who is the hunter that was so transformed ? There are many mythological proper names in Greek which can be traced back to their Aryan originals, and why should Orion be not similarly derived ? The story obviously points to the Vedic legends of Rudra, who is said to be still chasing Prajapati in the heavens. The Vedic legend has fully preserved all the three elements in the story--the hunier Rudra, the dog and the antelope's head, while the Greeks appear to have retained only the hunter and the dog with noihing to hunt ! But that does not preclude us from discovering the identity of these legends and the question is whether we can suggest a Sanskrit word which will give us Orion according to the already established phonetic rules. I know of no name of Rudra from which Orion can be so derived. But if we look to the names of the constellation of Mrigashiras, we may, I think, in the absence of any better suggestion provisionally derive Orion from Sapskrit Agayana the original of Agraharana; The intial long & in Sanskrit may be represented by omega in Greek as in Sk. ama, Gk. Ömos, Sk. āshu, Gr. okus, and the last word aydna may become tön in Greek. It is not, however, so easy to account for the dropping of g before , in the body of the word. Comparison of Sk. gravan which Gk, laos and of 8k. ghrāna with Gk. ris, rinos, shews that the change may take place initially, bot scholars whom I have consulted think that there is no instance in which it takes place medially
between Greek and Sanskrit, though such changes are not rare between other languages as in Old Irish ar, Cymric kar, which K. Brugmann i derives from\* agra. Also com pare Gk. Jakru, Goth. tagy, Old Irish dër, English tear; Latin exagmen, examen, O Ir. Am, from the root aj. I do not feel myself competent to decide the question, and hence must remain content with simply throwing out the sugges. tion for what it is worth. I have shewn that traditional coincidences clearly establish the possibility of the Aryan origin of Orion, and if I have not hit upon the correct word that does not affect my argument. My case does not, in fact, rest on phonetic coincidences. I rely principally upon certain statements in the Vedic works, which indicate that the vernal equinox was once in Orion, and I wanted to shew-and I think I have shewn il-that there is sufficient evidence in the Greek and Parsi legends to corroborate the statment in the Vedic works about the Phalgunt full-moon being once the first night of the year. We can now give a reasonable explanation of how Fravarshinam came to be the first month in the primitive Parsi calendar and why Dathusho should have been dedicated to Din (crcator).

By the bye it may be here remarked that we can perhaps better accouat for the ormes Aburamazda and Ahriinad on the theory that the vernal equinox was then in Orion, the winter solstice in Uttard Bhadrapada and the summer solstice in Uttar Phalgupt.

The mummeries and festivals amongst the Germans can also be more satisfactorily accounted for, while above all, the form the dress and the traditions of Orion may be now better traced and understood. I have already in the previous chapter shown that even the Vedic legends, espe. cially those in the later works, can be simply and paturally explained on the assumption we have made regarding the position of the equinoxes in the days of the Rigveda. The hypothesis on which so many facts, legeuds, and traditions can be so naturally explained, may, in the absence of a better theory, be fairly accepted, as correct without more proof. But in the present case we can go still further and adduce even direct evidence, or express Vedic texts, in its 
point, would come to be regarded as the supreme ruler of the gods, while Aryaman would be the king of the evil spirits. Therefore we may suppose that the pamcs Ahura Mazda and Ahriman, if not astually derived from these words, were, at least modelled after them. Amongst the names of the Vedic deities Ahir Budhaya is the only word, both the component members of woich, are declined 28 in Ahura Mazda Spant Mainyus and AnghraMainyus is a distiact pair by itself; and besides the difficulty of deriving Ahriman from Anghra Mainyus, there seems to be no reason why Abriman, if so derived, should be contrasted with Ahura Mazda. (See Thil. Mazd. Relig. by Casartelli, trans, by F.J. Dastur Jamasp Asa, $$ 71, 12, pp. 54-6.) Parsi mythology has another deity named Airyaman, and as this word is derived from Sanskrit Aryaman, it may be objected that same word cannot be said to have also given the pame for the evil spirit. I do not think that the objection is well founded. Cf. Andra (Sk, ladra and Verethraghna (Sk. Vsitraban) both of which are the names of the same deity in Sanskrit, but one of which has become an evil spirit in the Avesta, But I cannot fully discuss the subject in a note, and not being pertinent to my case, I cannot also do more than merely record here an explanation that may possibly be suggested.
support. In the chapter on the Ksiltikas, I have drawn attention to the remarks of Prof. Max Müller who objected to the conclusion based entirely on the Vedanga Jyotisha on the ground that no allusion to the position of the Kritlikas was to be found in the Vedic hymns. We can now account for this silence ; for how can the hymns, which appear to be sung when the sun was in Orion at the beginning of the year, contain any allusion to the period when the vernal equinox fell in the Kritlikas? This could have been easily perceived if, instead of confining to the controversy about the position of the Krittikās and endeavouring 10 find out if some clue to the date of the Veda could be oblaiped from the determina tion of the original number and source of the Nakshatras, scholars had pushed their inquiries further back and examined the Vedic hymns in the same critical spirit. It would not have been difficult in that case to discover the real meaning of the Vedic verse which states that "the dog awakened the Ribhus at the end of the year." I have in a previous chapter already referred to the verses in the Rigveda regarding the position of Yama's dogs and the death of Namuchi. These passages, as well as the description of Vrika or the dog-star rising before the sun after crossing the eternal waters, the terminus of the Devayapa (Rig. i. 105. 11.), sufficiently iudicate the position of the equinoxes in those days. In the next chapter 1 propose to discuss and examine two other important passages from the Rigveda, which directly bear out the statement in the Taittirya Sanhita with which we have started, vis., that the Phalguni full-moon commenced the year at the winter solstice in days previous to those of the Taittirya Banbita and the Brāhmaṇa.
