  <p>Tre volte il fe’ girar con tutte l’acque
alia quarta voltar la poppa in suso
e la prora ire in giu, com’altrui piacque
Infin che’l mar fu sopra noi richiuso.</p>
<p>Dante, Inferno</p>
<p>D ante kept to the tradition of the whirlpool as a significant
end for great figures, even if here it comes ordained by Providence.
Ulysses has sailed in his “mad venture” beyond the limits of the
world, and once he has crossed the ocean he sees a mountain loom¬
ing far away, “hazy with the distance, and so high I had never
seen any.” It is the Mount of Purgatory, forbidden to mortals.</p>
<p>“We rejoiced, and soon it turned to tears, for from the new land
a whirl was born, which smote our ship from the side. Three times
it caused it to revolve with all the waters, on the fourth to lift its
stern on high, and the prow to go down, as Someone willed, until
the sea had closed over us.” The “many thoughted” Ulysses is on
his way to immortality, even if it has to be Hell.</p>
<p>The engulfing whirlpool belongs to the stock-in-trade of ancient
fable. It appears in the Odyssey as Charybdis in the straits of Mes¬
sina—and again, in other cultures, in the Indian Ocean and in the
Pacific. It is found there too, curiously enough, with the overhang¬
ing fig tree to whose boughs the hero can cling as the ship goes
down, whether it be Satyavrata in India, or Kae in Tonga. Like
Sindbad’s magnetic mountain, it goes on in mariners’ yarns through
the centuries. But the persistence of detail rules out free invention.
Such stories have belonged to the cosmographical literature since</p>
<p>205 * The Whirlpool</p>
<p>antiquity. Medieval writers, and after them Athanasius Kircher,
located the gurges mirabilis, the wondrous eddy, somewhere off the
coast of Norway, or of Great Britain. It was the Maelstrom, plus
probably a memory of Pentland Firth. 1 It was generally in the
direction north-northwest, just as Saturn’s island, Ogygia, had been
vaguely placed “beyond” the British Isles by the Greeks.</p>
<p>On further search this juxtaposition seems to be the result of the
usual confusion between uranography and geography. There is
frequently a “gap” in the northwest (“Nine-Yin” for the Chinese)
of the heavens and inasmuch as the skeleton map of earth was de¬
rived from that of the sky, the gap was pinned down here as the
Maelstrom, or Ogygia. Both notions are far from obvious, as are
the localizations, and it is even more remarkable that they should
be frequently joined.</p>
<p>For the Norse (see chapter VI) the whirlpool came into being
from the unhinging of the Grotte Mill: the Maelstrom comes of the
hole in the sunken millstone. This comes from Snorri. The older
verses by Snaebjorn which described Hamlet’s Mill stated that the
nine maids of the island mill who in past ages ground Amlodhi’s
meal now drive a “host-cruel skerry-quern.” That this skerry-quern
means the whirlpool, and not simply the northern ocean, is backed
up through some more lines which Gollancz ascribes to Snaebjorn;
not that they were of crystal clarity, but again mill and whirlpool
are connected:</p>
<p>The island-mill pours out the blood of the flood goddess’s sisters</p>
<p>[i.e., the waves of the sea], so that [it] bursts from the feller of the</p>
<p>land: whirlpool begins strong. 2</p>
<p>No localization is indicated here, whereas the Finns point to
directions which are less vague than they sound. Their statement
that the Sampo has three roots—one in heaven, one in the earth, the
third in the water eddy—has a definite meaning, as will be shown.</p>
<p>1 See for Ireland, W. Stokes, “The Prose Tales in the Rennes Dindsenchas,” RC
16 (1895), no * J 45 : “A great whirlpool there is between Ireland and Scotland on
the North. It is the meeting of many seas [from NSEW]—it resembles an open
caldron which casts the draught down [and] up, and its roaring is heard like far-
off thunder ..</p>
<p>2 I. Gollancz, Hamlet in Iceland (1898), pp. xvii.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 206</p>
<p>But then also, Vainamoinen driving with his copper boat into the
“maw of the Maelstrom” is said to sail to “the depths of the sea,”
to the “lowest bowels of the earth,” to the “lowest regions of the
heavens.” Earth and heaven—a significant contraposition. As con¬
cerns the whereabouts of the whirlpool, one reads:</p>
<p>Before the gates of Pohjola,</p>
<p>Belong the threshold of color-covered Pohjola ,</p>
<p>There the pines roll with their roots ,</p>
<p>The pines fall crown first into the gullet of the whirlpool . 3</p>
<p>Then in Teutonic tradition, one finds in Adam of Bremen (nth
century):</p>
<p>Certain Frisian noblemen made a voyage past Norway up to the
farthest limits of the Arctic Ocean, got into a darkness which the
eyes can scarcely penetrate, were exposed to a maelstroem which
threatened to drag them down to Chaos, but finally came quite un¬
expectedly out of darkness and cold to an island which, surrounded
as by a wall of high rocks, contains subterranean caverns, wherein
giants lie concealed. At the entrances of the underground dwellings
lay a great number of tubs and vessels of gold and other metals which
“to mortals seem rare and valuable.” As much as the adventurers
could carry of these treasures they took with them and hastened to
their ships. But the giants, represented by great dogs, rushed after
them. One of the Frisians was overtaken and torn into pieces before
the eyes of the others. The others succeeded, thanks to our Lord and
Saint Willehad, in getting safely on board their ships . 4</p>
<p>The Latin text (Rydberg, p. 422) uses the classical familiar name
of Euripus. The Euripus, which has already come up in the Phaedo ,
was really a channel between Euboea and the mainland, in which
the conflict of tides reverses the current as much as seven times a
day, with ensuing dangerous eddies—actually a case of standing
waves rather than a true whirl. 5</p>
<p>3 M. Haavio, Vainamoinen , Eternal Sage (1952), pp. 191-98.</p>

<p>5 We meet the name again at a rather unexpected place, in the Roman circus or
hippodrome, as we know from J. Laurentius Lydus (De Mensihus 7.12.), who states
that the center of the circus was called Euripos; that in the middle of the stadium
was a pyramid, belonging to the Sun; that by the Sun’s pyramid were three altars,
of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and below the pyramid, altars of Venus, Mercury and the</p>
<p>207 * The Whirlpool</p>
<p>And here the unstable Euripus of the Ocean, which flows back to the
beginnings of its mysterious source, dragged with irresistible force
the unhappy sailors, thinking by now only of death, towards Chaos.
This is said to be the maw of the abyss, that unknown depth in which,
it is understood, the ebb and flow of the whole sea is absorbed and
then thrown up again, which is the cause of the tides.</p>
<p>This is reflection of what had been a popular idea of antiquity.
But here comes a version of the same story in North America. 6 It
concerns the canoe adventure of two Cherokees at the mouth of
Suck Creek. One of them was seized by a fish, and never seen again.
The other was</p>
<p>taken round and round to the very lowest center of the whirlpool,
when another circle caught him and bore him outward. He told after¬
wards that when he reached the narrowest circle of the maelstroem
the water seemed to open below and he could look down as through
the roof beam of a house, and there on the bottom of the river he had
seen a great company, who looked up and beckoned to him to join
them, but as they put up their hands to seize him the swift current
caught him and took him out of their reach.</p>
<p>It is almost as if the Cherokees have retained the better memory,
when they talk of foreign regions, inhabited by “a great company”
—which might equally well be the dead, or giants with their dogs—
there, where in “the narrowest circle of the maelstroem the water
seemed to open below.” It will be interesting to see whether or not
this impression is justifiable. 7</p>
<p>Snorri, who has preserved the Song of Grotte for us, does not
actually name the whirlpool in it, but there is only one at hand.</p>
<p>Moon, and that there were not more than seven circuits ( kykloi ) around the pyra¬
mid, because the planets were only seven. (See also F. M. Cornford&rsquo;s chapter on the
origin of the Olympic games in J. Harrison&rsquo;s Themis (196:), p. ::S; G. Higgins’
AtucaJypsis (19:7), vol. 2, pp. 377ft.) This brings to mind (although not called
Euripus, obviously, but “the god&rsquo;s place of skulls&rdquo;) the Central American Ball
Court which had a round hole in its center, termed by Tezozomoc “the enigmatic
significance of the ball court,” and from this hole a lake spread out before Uitzilo-
pochtli was born. See W. Krickeberg, “Der mittelamerikanische Ballspielplatz und
seine religiose Symbolik,&rdquo; Faideuma 5 (194S), pp. 135ft., 155, 162.</p>

<p>namely the “Hvergelmer” in 1 lei&rsquo;s abode of the dead, from and to
which “all waters find their way.” 8 Says Rydberg:</p>
<p>It appears that the mythology conceived Hvergelmer as a vast reser¬
voir, the mother fountain of all the waters of the world. In the front
rank are mentioned a number of subterranean rivers which rise in
Hvergelmer, and seek their courses thence in various directions. But
the waters of earth and heaven also come from this immense fountain,
and after completing their circuits they return thither.</p>
<p>Idle myth about Hvergelmer and its subterranean connection with
the ocean gave our ancestors the explanation of ebb and flood tide.
High up in the northern channels the bottom of the ocean opened
itself in a hollow tunnel, \ hich led down to the “kettle-roarer,” “the
one roaring in his basin” (hverr = kettle; galm = Anglo-Saxon gealm =
a roaring). When the waters of the ocean poured through this tunnel
dow n into the 1 lades-well there was ebb-tide, when it returned water
from its superabundance then was flood-tide.</p>
<p>Between the death-kingdom and the ocean there was, therefore, one
connecting link, perhaps several. Most of the people who drowned
did not remain with Ran. Acgir&rsquo;s wife, Ran, received them hospita¬
bly, according to the Icelandic sagas of the middle ages. She had a
hall in the bottom of the sea, where they were welcomed and offered
. . . seat and bed. Her realm was only an ante-chamber to the realms
of death. 9</p>
<p>There are several features of the Phaedo here, but they will turn
up again in Gilgamesh. This is not to deny that Hvergelmer, and
other whirlpools, explain the tides, as indicated previously. (Perhaps
it will be possible to find out what tides “mean” on the celestial
level.) But it is clear that the Maelstrom as the cause of the tides does
not account for the surrounding features, not even for the few
mentioned by Rydberg—for instance, the wife of the Sea-god
Aegir who receives kindly the souls of drowned seafarers in her
antechamber at the bottom of the sea—nor the circumstance that the
Frisian adventurers, sucked into the Maelstrom, suddenly find them¬
selves on a bright island filled with gold, where giants lie concealed</p>
<p>8 Grimnis?nxl :6; cf. Snorri, Gy If. 15.</p>
<p>9 Rydberg, pp. 414. 421L Cf. the notions about the nun Saint Gertrude, patron of
travelers, particularly on sea voyages, who acted also as patron saint of inns “and
finally it was claimed that she was the hostess of a public house, where the souls
spent the first night after death&rdquo; (.\L Hako, D.is Wiesel ifJ der europliischeri
Volksuberlicfcrimgy FFC 167 [1956], p. 119).</p>

<p>in the mountain caves. This island begins to look very much like
Ogygia I, where Kronos/Saturn sleeps in a golden mountain cave,
whereas the reception hall of Ran—her husband Aegir was famous
for his beer brewing, and his hall it was, where Loke offended all
his fellow gods as reported in the Lokasemia —would suggest rather
Ogygia II, the island of Calypso, sister of Prometheus, called
Omphalos Thalasses, the Navel of the Sea. Calypso was the daughter
of Atlas, “who knew the depths of the whole sea.” She, Calypso, has
been authoritatively compared 10 to the divine barmaid Siduri, who
dwells by the deep sea and will be found later on in the tale of
Gilgamesh.</p>
<p>Mythology, meaning proper poetic fable, has been of great as¬
sistance but it can help no further. The golden island of Kronos,
the tree-girt island of Calypso, remain unlocatable, notwithstanding
the efforts of Homeric scholars. Through careful analysis of navi¬
gational data, one of them (Berard) has placed Calypso in the
island of Perejil near Gibraltar, another (Bradfield) in Malta,
others even off Africa. Presumably it should not be too far from
Sicily, since Ulysses reaches it riding on the mast of his ship, right
after having escaped from Charybdis in the straits of Messina, in
the setting that Homer describes so plausibly. It appears throughout
time in many places. 11 Some data in Homer look like exact geogra¬
phy, as Circe&rsquo;s Island with its temple of Feronia, or the Land of the
Laistrygones, which should be the bay of Bonifacio. But most ele¬
ments from past myth, like Charybdis or the Planktai, are illusion-
istic. They throw the whole geography into a cocked hat, as do
the Argonauts themselves.</p>
<p>Without trying to fathom Ogygia, or Ogygos, the adjective
“Ogygian”—which has been used as a label for the Waters of Styx
—has also assumed the connotation of “antediluvian.” As for Hver-
gelmer, “roaring kettle,” it is the “navel of the waters” but it is
certainly “way down,” as is the strange “Bierstube” of Aegir. And
when it is found, as it soon will be, that Utnapishtim (the builder</p>

<p>11 The last learned attempt to locate it—by H. H. and A. Wolf, Der T Veg des
Odysseus (1968)—proves as illusionistic as the previous ones.</p>

<p>of the Ark, who can lie reached only by the road leading through
the bar of the divine Siduri and hence also, one would say, through
the inn of beer-brewing Aegir) lives forever at the “confluence of
the rivers,” this might have charmed Socrates with his idea of con¬
fluences, but it will not make things much clearer.</p>
<p>Yet there arc some footholds to climb back from the abyss. It is
known (chapter XII) that Socrates and the poets really referred to
heaven “seen from the other side.”</p>
<p>It has been shown that the way through the “navel of the waters”
was taken by Vainamoinen, and we shall see (chapter XIX) that the
same goes for Kronos-Phaethon, and other powerful personalities
as well, who reached the Land of Sleep where time has ceased. One
can anticipate that the meaning will be ultimately astronomical.
Hence, backing out of fable, one can turn again for assistance to
the Royal Science.</p>
<p>That there is a whirlpool in the sky is well known; it is most prob¬
ably the essential one, and it is precisely placed. It is a group of stars
so named ( zalos) at the foot of Orion, close to Rigel (beta Orionis,
Rigel being the Arabic word for “foot”), the degree of which was
called “death,” according to Hermes Trismegistos, 12 whereas the
Maori claim outright that Rigel marked the way to Hades (Castor
indicating the primordial homeland). Antiochus the astrologer enu¬
merates the whirl among the stars rising with Taurus. Franz Boll
takes sharp exception to the adequacy of his description, but he
concludes that the zalos must, indeed, be Eridanus “which flows
from the foot of Orion.” 13 Now Eridanus, the watery grave of
Phaethon—Athanasius Kircher’s star map of the southern hemi¬
sphere still shows Phaethon’s mortal frame lying in the stream—
was seen as a starry river leading to the other world. The initial
frame stands, this time traced in the sky. And here comes a crucial
confirmation. That mysterious place, pi ndrati, literally the “mouth
of the rivers,” meaning, however, the “confluence” of the rivers,
was traditionally identified by the Babylonians with Eridu. But the</p>

<p>211 • The Whirlpool</p>
<p>archaeological site of Eridu is nowhere near the confluence of
the Two Rivers of Mesopotamia. It is between the Tigris and
Euphrates, which flow separately into the Red Sea, and placed
rather high up. The proposed explanation, that it was the expand¬
ing of alluvial land which removed Eridu from the joint “mouth&rdquo;
of the rivers, did not contribute much to an understanding of the
mythical topos of pi mrati , and some perplexed philologist sup¬
posed in despair that those same archaic people who had built up
such impressive waterworks had never known which way the
waters flow and had believed, instead, that the two rivers had their
source in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>This particular predicament was solved by XV. F. Albright, who
exchanged “mouth” and “source&rdquo;; 14 he left us stranded “high and
dry&rdquo;—a very typical mythical situation, by the way—in the Arme¬
nian mountains around the “source.” And though he stressed,
rightly, that Eridu-p; narati could not mean geography, he banished
it straightaway into the interior of the planet.</p>
<p>The “source” is as unrevealing as the “mouth” has been, and as
every geographical localization is condemned to be. Eridu, Sumerian
inul NUN ki , is Canopus, alpha Carinae, the bright star near the South
Pole, as has been established irrefragably by B. L. van der Waerden, 15
a distinguished contemporary historian of astronomy. That one or
another part of Argo was meant had been calculated previously. 16
And that, finally, made sense of the imposing configuration of
myths around Canopus on the one hand, and of the preponderance
of the ‘‘confluence of the rivers&rdquo; on the other hand. This unique
topos will be dealt with later.</p>
<p>One point still remains a problem. The way of the dead to the
other world had been thought to be the Milky Way, and that since
the oldest days of high civilization. This image was still alive with
the Pythagoreans. When and how did Eridanus come in? A reason¬
able supposition is that this was connected with the observed shift-</p>

<p>ing of the equinoctial colure 17 due to the Precession. But the analysis
of this intricate problem of rivers will come in the chapter on the
Galaxy.</p>
<p>One thing meanwhile stands firm: the real, the original, way from
the whirlpool lies in heaven. With this finding, one may plunge
again into the bewildering jungle of “earthly” myths concerning
the Waters from the Deep.</p>
<p>17 The equinoctial colure is the great circle which passes through the celestial
poles and the equinoctial points: the solstitial colure runs through both the celes¬
tial and ecliptic poles and through the solstitial points. Macrobius has it, strange
to say, that “they are not believed to extend to the South Pole,” whence kolouros ,
meaning “dock-tailed,” “which are so called because they do not make complete
circles” (Comm. Somn. Scip. 1. 15.14). The translator, W. H. Stahl (p. 151), refers,
among others, to Geminus 1.49-50. Geminus, however (5.49, Manitius, pp. 60-
61), does not claim such obvious nonsense; he states the following: “Kolouroi they
are called, because certain of their parts are not visible (dia to mere tina auton
atheoreta ginesthai). Whereas the other circles become visible in their whole ex¬
tension with the revolution of the cosmos, certain parts of the Colures remain invi¬
sible, ‘docked’ by the antarctical circle below the horizon.”</p>
