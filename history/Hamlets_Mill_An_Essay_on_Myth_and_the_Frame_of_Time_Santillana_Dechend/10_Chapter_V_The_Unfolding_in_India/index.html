<p>JL he parallel between the Tale of Kai Khusrau and the final
plot of the vast Hindu epic, the Mahabharata , has received attention
for over a century. It was noticed by the great Orientalist James
Darmesteter. The translators of Firdausi are not unaware of it, and
they analyze the last phase of events as follows:</p>
<p>The legend of Kai Khusrau’s melancholy, his expedition into the
mountains, and his attainment to heaven without having tasted death
has its parallel in the Mahabharata , where Yudhishthira, the eldest of
the five Pandavas, becoming weary of the world, resolves to retire
from the sovereignty and acquire merit by pilgrimage. On hearing of
his intentions his four brothers—Bhima, Arjuna, and the twins Na-
kula and Sahadeva—resolve to follow his example and accompany
him. Yudhishthira appoints successors to his various kingdoms. The
citizens and the inhabitants of the provinces, hearing the king’s
words, became filled with anxiety and disapproved of them. “This
should never be done”—said they unto the king. The monarch, well
versed with the changes brought about by time, did not listen to
their counsels. Possessed of righteous soul, he persuaded the people
to sanction his views . . . Then Dharma’s son, Yudhishthira, the King
of Pandavas, casting off his ornaments, wore barks of trees . . . The
five brothers, with Draupadi forming the sixth [she was the joint
wife of the brothers], and a dog forming the seventh, set out on their
journey. The citizens and the ladies of the royal household followed</p>
<p>77 • The Unfolding in India</p>
<p>them for some distance . . . The denizens of the city then returned
[exactly as Kai Khusrau’s subjects had done]. The seven pilgrims
meanwhile had set out upon their journey. They first wandered east¬
ward, then southward, and then westward. Lastly they faced north¬
ward and crossed the Himalaya. Then they beheld before them a
vast desert of sand and beyond it Mount Meru. One by one the pil¬
grims sank exhausted and expired, first Draupadi, then the twins, then
Arjuna, then Bhima; but Yudhishthira, who never even looked back
at his fallen comrades, still pressed on and, followed by the faithful
dog who turns out to be Dharma (the Law), in disguise, entered
Heaven in his mortal body, not having tasted death.</p>
<p>Among minor common traits, Warner stresses particularly these:</p>
<p>Both journey into the mountains with a devoted band, the number
of them is the same in both cases, and both are accompanied by a
divine being, for the part of the dog in the Indian legend is indicated
in the Iranian as being taken by Surush, the angel of Urmuzd. In
both, the leaders pass deathless into Heaven, and in both their mor¬
tal comrades perish. One legend therefore must be derived from the
other, or else, and this seems to be the better opinion, they must be
referred to a common origin of great antiquity. 1</p>
<p>Of great antiquity these legends must be, indeed; otherwise there
would not be a very similar end ascribed to Enoch and to Quetzal-
couatl. In fact, just as Kai Khusrau’s paladins did not listen to the
Shah’s advice not to remain with him until k his ascension—the crowd
had been left behind, anyhow—so Enoch</p>
<p>urged his retinue to turn back: “Go ye home, lest death overtake you,
if you follow me farther.” Most of them—800,000 there were—
heeded his words and went back, but a number remained with him
for six days. . . On the sixth day of the journey, he said to those still
accompanying him, “Go ye home, for on the morrow I shall ascend
to heaven, and whoever will then be near me, he will die.” Neverthe¬
less, some of his companions remained with him, saying: “Whither¬
soever thou goest, we will go. By the living God, death alone shall
part us.” On the seventh day Enoch was carried into the heavens in
a fiery chariot drawn by fiery chargers. The day thereafter, the kings
who had turned back in good time sent messengers to inquire into the
fate of the men who had refused to separate themselves from Enoch,
for they had noted the number of them. They found snow and great
hailstones upon the spot whence Enoch had risen, and, when they
searched beneath, they discovered the bodies of all who had remained</p>

<p>behind with Enoch. He alone was not among them; he was on high</p>
<p>in heaven. 2</p>
<p>Quetzalcouad’s paladins, “the slaves, the dwarves, the hunch
backed . . . they died there from the cold . . . , upon all of them fell
the snow,” in the mountain pass between Popocatepetl and Iztacte-
petl. 3 4 5 Quetzalcouatl, lamenting, and utterly lonely, had some more
stations to pass, before he took off on his serpent raft, announcing
he would come back, someday, “to judge the living and the dead”
(appendix #3).</p>
<p>Were it only the dry fact of Yudhishthira’s ascension, and the
end of his companions high up in the mountains, we might have
avoided the maze of the Mahabharata altogether. But, labyrinthine
as this epic of twelve volumes truly is—and the same goes for the
Puranas —Indian myth offers keys to secret chambers to be had
nowhere else. The Mahabharata tells of the war of the Pandavas
and the Kauravas, that is the Pandu brothers and the Kuru brothers,
who correspond to the Iranians and Turanians, to the sons of Ka-
leva and the people of Untamo, etc. Thus far the general situation
is not foreign to us. But the epic states unmistakably that this tre¬
mendous war was fought during the interval between the Dvapara
and the Kali Yugad</p>
<p>This “dawn” between two world-ages can be specified further.
The real soul and force on the side of the Pandavas is Krishna—in
the words of Arjuna: “He, who was our strength, our might, our
heroism, our prowess, our prosperity, our brightness, has left us, and
departed.” 3 Now Krishna (“the Black”) is the most outstanding
avatar of Vishnu. And it is only when Krishna has been shot in the
heel (or the sole of his foot), the only vulnerable spot of his body,
by the hunter Jara (= old age) that the Pandavas, too, resolve to
depart—just as Kai Khusrau did after the death of Kai Ka&rsquo;us. There
was Kai Khusrau’s statement: “And now I deem it better to de-</p>

<p>part . . . Because this Kaian crown and throne will pass.” And this
happens at the following crucial point:</p>
<p>When that portion of Vishnu (that had been born by Vasudeva and
Devakij returned to heaven, then the Kali age commenced. As long
as the earth was touched by his sacred feet, the Kali age could not
affect it. As soon as the incarnation of the eternal Vishnu had de¬
parted, the son of Dharma, Yudhishthira, with his brethren, abdicated
the sovereignty . . . The day that Krishna shall have departed from
the earth will be the first of the Kali age &hellip; it will continue for
360,000 years of mortals. 6</p>
<p>And as Krishna is reunited with Vishnu, as Arjuna returns into
Indra, 7 and Balarama into the Shesha-Serpent, so it will happen to
the other heroes. Thus, when Yudhishthira is finally rejoined with
his whole Pandu-Family in heaven, the poet Sauti explains,</p>
<p>“That the various heroes, after exhausting their Karma, become re¬
united with that deity of which they were avatars.” 8</p>
<p>Yudhishthira is reunited with Dharma, disguised as a faithful dog. 9
Seen from this vantage point, the Finnish epic appears as a last dim
and apparently meaningless reflection. Kullervo goes with the black
dog Musti, the only living soul left from his home, into the forest
where he throws himself upon his sword.</p>
<p>Now what about Krishna, most beloved deity of the Hinduistic
Pantheon? Some of his innumerable deeds and victorious adventures
before his “departure” will look familiar.</p>
<p>6 Vishnu Fur ana ^.24 (Wilson trans., p. 390). Cf. 5.38, pp. 48 if.: “and on the same
day that Krishna departed from the earth the powerful dark-bodied Kali age
descended. The ocean rose, and submerged the whole of Dvaraka,” i.e., the town
which Krishna himself had built, as told in Vishnu Pur ana j.23, p. 449.</p>

<p>9 Arrived at the last stage of deterioration, we find Dharma, the Dog, in a fairy
tale from Albania: The youngest daughter of a king—her two sisters resemble
Regan and Goneril—offers to go to war in her father’s place, asking for three suits
only, and for the paternal blessing. “Then the king procured three male suits, and
gave her his blessing, and this blessing changed into a little dog and went with the
princess.” (J. G. von Hahn: Griechische und Albanische Mdrchen [1918., vol. a,
p. 146.).</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 80</p>
<p>Young Krishna is the persecuted nephew of a cruel uncle, Kansa
(or Kamsa), both being, as Keith 10 styles it, “protagonists in a ritual
contest.” This is not modestly understating it, but grossly mislead¬
ing. Kansa is an Asura (appendix #4), and Krishna is a Deva, and
that means, again, that the affair concerns the great divine “Parties”
(Iranians-Turanians, and the like). The uncle, warned beforehand
through prophecies about the danger coming from the eighth son
of Devaki and Vasudeva, kills six children of this couple, but the
seventh (Balarama) and eighth (Krishna) are saved and live with
herdsmen. There young Krishna performs some of the deeds of the
“Strong Boy.”</p>
<p>If Kullervo, three days old, destroyed his cradle, we might ex¬
pect something spectacular from Krishna, and we are not disap¬
pointed:</p>
<p>On one occasion, whilst iVladhusudana was asleep underneath the
wagon, he cried for the breast, and kicking up his feet he overturned
the vehicle, and all the pots and pans were upset and broken. The
cowherds and their wives, hearing the noise, came exclaiming: “Ah!
ah!” and they found the child sleeping on his back. “Who could have
upset the wagon?” said the cowherds. “This child,” replied some
boys, who witnessed the circumstance; “w r e saw him,” said they,
“crying, and kicking the wagon w 7 ith his feet, and so it w 7 as over¬
turned: no one else had any thing to do v T ith it.” The cow r herds w r ere
exceedingly astonished at this account. 11</p>
<p>One day the child repeatedly disobeyed his mother and she
became angry.</p>
<p>Fastening a cord round his w r aist, she tied him to the wooden mortar
Ulukhala, and being in a great passion, she said to him, “Now, you
naughty boy, get av T ay from hence if you can.” She then went to her
domestic affairs. As soon as she had departed, the lotus-eyed Krishna,
endeavouring to extricate himself, pulled the mortar after him to the
space between the two ariuna trees that grew 7 near together. Having
dragged the mortar between these trees, it became wedged awry
there, and as Krishna pulled it through, it pulled down the trunks of
the trees. Hearing the crackling noise, the people of Vraja came to
see w T hat w r as the matter, and there they beheld the tw r o large trees,</p>

<p>with shattered stems and broker, branches, prostrate on the ground,
with the child fixed between them, with a rope round his belly,
laughing, and showing his little white teeth, just budded . . . The
elders of the cowherds . . . looked upon these circumstances with
alarm, considering them of evil omen. “We cannot remain in this
place.&quot; said they, &ldquo;let us go to some other part of the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, they go to Yrindavana, exactly where the child had
wished. The Harivamsha explains the move to Yrindavana in this
way:</p>
<p>Krishna converts the hairs of his body into hundreds of wolves, who</p>
<p>so harass and alarm the inhabitants of Yraja—the said cowherds—.</p>
<p>that they determine to abandon their homes. 12</p>
<p>In the Indian myth, for once, the episode of Krishna&rsquo;s hairs turn¬
ing into hundreds of wolves seems a mere trifle, compared with
Kullervo’s wolves which “he sang to cattle, and he changed the
bears to oxen.&quot; the more so. as Krishna’s only &ldquo;harass and alarm&rdquo;
the cowherds. These wild beasts, however, indispensable to the
&ldquo;Urkind.&rdquo; whether Kullervo or Dionysos—see above, p. 30—are
present in Krishna&rsquo;s story, and this is remarkable enough.</p>
<p>Kansa, 13 hearing of the deeds of Krishna and Rama, determines to
have the boys brought to his capital Mathura and there to procure
their death, if he cannot slay them before. Needless to say. all is in
vain: Krishna kills Kansa and all his soldiers, and places Kansa&rsquo;s
father on the throne.</p>
<p>Krishna does not pretend to be a fool, the smiling one. He merely
insists again and again on being a simple mortal when everybody
wishes to adore him as the highest god. which he is. Nor is he
known particularly as an &ldquo;avenger.&rdquo; He was delegated from higher
quarters to free the earth—“overburdened&quot; as it was with Asura—
as he had done time and again in his former avatars. Krishna belongs
here, however, because Indian tradition has preserved the con¬
sciousness of the cosmic frame, and it is this alone that gives mean-</p>

<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 82</p>
<p>ing to the incidence of war and the notion of crime and punishment
as they appear in myth.</p>
<p>It is useful to keep philosophy and mythology carefully sepa¬
rated, and yet the many gods and heroes who avenge their fathers
—beginning with “Horus-the-avenger-of-his-father” and “Ninurta
who has avenged his father”—have their function destined to them,
as has the long line of wicked uncles. These figures pay reparation
and atonement to each other for their mutual injustice in the order
of time, as Anaximander said. Anaximander was a philosopher.
Despite its fantastic language the Indian epic has an affinity with his
thought. Vishnu returns regularly in his capacity of “avenger,”
collecting the “reparations” of the bad uncle “according to the
order of time.” In the Mahabharata he does so under the name of
Krishna, but he will come again in the shape of another avatar to
clean the earth of the Asura who overburden it. The Asura, too,
grow into “overbearing characters” strictly according to the order
of time. Under the name of Kalki the Vishnu figure is expected to
introduce a new Krita Yuga (Golden Age), when our present Kali
Yuga has come to its miserable end.</p>
<p>It is this regular returning of avatars of Vishnu which helps
clarify matters. Because it is Vishnu’s function to return as avenger
at fixed intervals of time, there is no need in the epic to emphasize
the revenge taken by Krishna on Uncle Kansa. But in the West,
where the continuity of cosmic processes as told by myth has been
forgotten—along with the knowledge that gods are stars—the very
same revenge is given great importance because it is an unrepeated
event accomplished by one figure, whether hero or god, and this
hero or god is, moreover, understood to be the creation of some
imaginative poet. The introduction of Indian tradition makes it
possible to rediscover the context in which such characters as
Saxo’s Amlethus, such typically unlucky fellows as Kullervo, have
significance. Once it is fully realized that “the day Krishna shall
have departed from the earth will be the first of the Kali Yuga,”
the proper perspective is established. Our hero stands precisely on
the threshold between a closed age and a new Time Zero. In fact,
he closes the old one.</p>
<p>83 • The Unfolding in India</p>
<p>The most inconspicuous details become significant when ob¬
served from this point of view. For instance Saxo, without giving
it much thought, divided the biography of Amlethus in two parts
(incidentally involving the hero in bigamy), in the same way as
Firdausi told us nine-tenths of Kai Khusrau’s adventures in the
book on Kai Ka’us. This is actually the more puzzling of the two
as Firdausi states: ‘‘For from today new feasts and customs date /
Because tonight is born Shah Kai Khusrau.” Firdausi, who was well
versed in astrology, insisted on the Shah’s birthday because, in the
astrological sense, birth is the decisive moment. But here, and in
related cases where chronology is at issue, it is the moment of
death, of leaving the stage, that counts. Krishna’s departure gives
the scheme away. Al-Biruni, in his chapter on ‘‘The Festivals of
the Months of the Persians,” describing the festival Nauroz (“New
Day”) in the first month of spring, writes:</p>
<p>On the 6th day of Farwardin, the day Khurdadh, is the Great Nau¬
roz, for the Persians a feast of great importance. On this day—they
say—God finished the creation, for it is the last of the six days . . .
On this day God created Saturn, therefore its most lucky hours are
those of Saturn. On the same day—they say—the Sors Zarathustrae
came to hold communion with God, and Kai khusrau ascended into
the air. On the same day the happy lots are distributed among the
people of the earth. Therefore the Persians call it “the day of hope.&quot; 14</p>
<p>The so-called Kaianian Dynasty—the “Heroes” according to
Al-Biruni’s Chronology 15 —succeeding the first Pishdadian Dynasty
(“the Just”), is supposed to have started with Kai Kubad, his son
Kai Ka’us, and the latter’s grandson Kai Khusrau, and to have
ended with Sikander, Alexander the Great, with whose death a new
era actually began. But it is obvious that something new begins
with Kai Khusrau’s assumption into heaven. Thus, the Warners
state that with our Shah “the old epic cycle of the poem comes to
an end, and up to this point the Kaianian may be regarded as the
complement of the Pishdadian dynasty.” 16</p>
<p>14 Al-Biruni, The Chronology of Ancient Nations (trans. C. E. Sachau [1879],
p. 201).</p>
<p>« P. 112.</p>
<p>16 Firdausi, Shahnama (Warner trans.), vol. pp. 8f.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 84</p>
<p>In his introduction to the Firdausi translation, however, the
Warners claim that the poem is divided into two periods, one
mythic, the other historic: 17</p>
<p>This distinction is based not so much on the nature of the subject-
matter as on the names of the chief characters. At a certain point in
the poem the names cease to be mythic and become historic. The
mythic period extends from the beginning of the narrative down to
the reigns of the last two Shahs of the Kaianian dynasty . . . The
Shahs in question are Dara, son of Darab, better known as Darius
Codomanus, and Sikander (Alexander).” 18</p>
<p>Firdausi makes it clear that the mythic period ends only with the
death of Alexander, the two last Shahs being Darius Codomanus
and Alexander who overcame him. After him begins the “historic”
period of the poem. In other words, “history” begins only when the
Iranian empire vanishes from the scene, to be replaced by the suc¬
cessors of Alexander. To remove from history the great and solidly
historical feats of Darius I, Xerxes, Cambyses, etc., is paradoxical
for a poem which is meant to celebrate the Iranian empire. Pre¬
sumably Firdausi meant that so long as the Zoroastrian religion
reigned, time was holy and thus belonged to myth rather than
ordinary history. This is confirmed by a strange statement of the
Warners: “Rightly or wrongly, Zoroastrian tradition couples Alex¬
ander with Zahhak and Afrasiyab as one of the three arch-enemies
of the faith.” 19</p>
<p>The great myths of the Avestan religion have overcome chronol¬
ogy and reshaped it to their purpose. The true kings of Persia have
disappeared notwithstanding their glory, and are replaced by myth¬
ical rulers and mythical struggles. Kai Khusrau rehearses a “Jam-
shyd” role in his beginnings, and with his ascent to heaven—the
date of which marks New Year from now on—the Holy Empire</p>
<p>17 The time structure is a very complicated one, and we cannot manage with a
subdivision of two “periods” at all, the less so, as the reigns of the Shahs overlap
with the rather miraculous lifetimes of the “heroes” or Paladins (Rustam, Zal, etc.).
The same goes for the “primordial” emperors of China and their “vassals.” But
God protect us from meddling with lists of alleged “kings” from whichever area,
but particularly from the Iranian tables!</p>
<p>18 Firdausi, vol. /, pp. 49F</p>
<p>19 Firdausi, vol. i, p. 59.</p>
<p>85 * The Unfolding in India</p>
<p>really comes to a close. The struggle has been between gods and
demons throughout.</p>
<p>We have been following the story of powers coming to an end,
embodied first in the Iranian then in the Indian “kings,” a story
which is differently emphasized by two different legends. Each
legend has a disturbing similarity to the other, and each removes
the narration from any known classic pattern, forcing the events
to a catastrophic conclusion which is clearly commanded by Time
itself, and by a very different chain of causes than that indicated
by the actual sequence of events in the texts.</p>
<p>To avoid misunderstanding it should be emphasized that it is not
possible yet to know precisely who is who, or to make positive
identifications such as saying that Brjam is Yudhishthira or Krishna.
But the hints provided by Iranians and Indians may lead to a better
understanding of Kullervo (“Kaleva is reborn in him”), and may
indicate that the feat of the doggish fool Brutus in driving out the
Kings was significant on a higher level than the political. This is
not to deny that the Kings were expelled, but rather to point to
a special set of firmly coined “figures of speech” derived from
“large” changes or shifts (such as the onset of Kali Yuga) that
could be, and were, applied to minor historical events.</p>
