<p>-L he great and official myth concerning the Galaxy is Phae-
thon’s transgression and the searing of the sky in his mad course.
Manilius tells it in his astrological poem : 1</p>
<p>. . . this was once the Path
Where Phoebus drove; and that in length of Years
The heated track took Fire and burnt the Stars.</p>
<p>The Colour changed, the Ashes strewed the Way,</p>
<p>And still preserve the marks of the Decay:</p>
<p>Besides, Fame tells, by Age Fame reverend grown,</p>
<p>That Phoebus gave his Chariot to his Son,</p>
<p>And whilst the Youngster from the Path declines
Admiring the strange Beauty of the Signs,</p>
<p>Proud of his Charge, He drove the fiery horse,</p>
<p>And would outdo his Father in his Course .</p>
<p>The North grew warm, and the unusual Fire
Dissolv&rsquo;d its Snow, and made the Bears retire;</p>
<p>Nor was the Earth secure, each Contrey mourn&rsquo;d
The Common Fate, and in its City&rsquo;s burn&rsquo;d .</p>
<p>Then from the scatter&rsquo;d Chariot Lightning came,</p>

<p>251 • The Fall of Phaethon</p>
<p>And the whole Skies were one continued Flame.</p>
<p>The World took Fire, and in new kindled Stars</p>
<p>The bright remembrance of its Fate it bears.</p>
<p>The myth of Phaethon has been told broadly and with magnifi¬
cent fantasy by Ovid (Met. 1. 747-2.400) and by Nonnos ( Dio-
nysiaka Book 38). Gibbon in his old age, commemorating his own
adolescence, speaks of his rapt discovery of the beauty of Latin
poetry as he read Ovid’s description of the tragic venture of
Phaethon. The story goes on that Helios, taking his oath by the
waters of Styx, promised to fulfill any wish of his rash young son
Phaethon, who was visiting him for the first time. The boy had only
one desire, to drive the Sun’s chariot once, and the most desperate
requests of his father could not move him to change his mind.
Although knowing well that nothing could prevent the fatal ending
of this adventure, Helios did his best to teach Phaethon all the dan¬
gers lurking at every step of the way—a welcome occasion for
both poets to elaborate the paternal admonitions into some kind of
“introduction to astronomy.” As the father feared, Phaethon was
incapable of managing the horses and came off the proper path;
Ovid has it that the boy dropped the reins at the sight of Scorpius.
Unbelievable confusion results; no constellation remains in its place,
and the Earth is terribly scorched. In despair “she” cries aloud to
Jupiter to make him act immediately: “Look how your heavens
blaze from pole to pole—if fire consumes them the very universe
will fall to dust. In pain, in worry, Atlas almost fails to balance the
world’s hot axis on his shoulders.” 2 And Nonnos states (38.35 off.):
“There was tumult in the sky shaking the joints of the immovable
universe; the very axle bent which runs through the middle of the
revolving heavens. Libyan Atlas could hardly support the self¬
rolling firmament of stars, as he rested on his knees with bowed
back under this greater burden.”</p>
<p>Zeus has to intervene and hurls his thunderbolt at the boy. Phae¬
thon falls into the river Eridanus where, according to Apollonios</p>
<p>2 Met. 2. 294-97: circumspice utrumque:/ fumat uterque polus quos si vitiaverit
ignis/atria vestra nient Atlas en ipse laborat/ vixque suis umeris candentem sustinet</p>
<p>axem.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 252</p>
<p>Rhodios, the stench of his half-burned corpse made the Argonauts
sick for several days when they came upon it in their travels
(4.619-23).</p>
<p>The Phaethon story has often been understood to commemorate
some great flashing event in the skies, whether comet or meteor.
Everyone rushes by instinct—more accurately, habit—for a so-
called natural explanation. But on examination, the case turns out
not to be so easy. The narrating of the cataclysm may be fanciful
and impressionistic, as if the poets enjoyed an emotional release
from the regularity of celestial orbs, but their account also makes
technical sense, as anyone would suspect who has read Stegemann’s 3
solid inquiry into Nonnos as the heir to Dorotheos of Sidon’s tight-
knit astrology. As for Ovid, his standing as a scholar is by now
unchallenged and, in fact, he hints at rigid cosmological formulae
with surprising authority. In his description of the “hidden moun¬
tains” emerging from the waves, when the seas shrank into sand
(2.260S .)—they rise as “new islands.” How much better does this
image of “mountain peaks” and “islands” illustrate the stars of a
constellation rising, one after the other (at vernal equinox), than,
for instance, the Icelandic wording of the emerging of “a new
earth”!</p>
<p>In any case, an independent confirmation emerges in Plato’s
version of the crisis, as he gives it in Timaeus 22CE. The Egyptian
priest talking with Solon states that the legend of Phaethon “has the
air of a fable; but the truth behind it is a deviation [parallaxis ] of
the bodies that revolve in heaven round the earth, and a destruction,
occurring at long intervals, of things on earth by a great conflagra¬
tion.” This is a clear statement, and one in accordance with Ovid
and with Nonnos, as it should be, since it has to do with a Pytha¬
gorean tradition: Aristotle tells us so. 4</p>
<p>3 Astrologie and Universalgeschichte (1930).</p>
<p>4 Meteorologica /.8.345A: “The so-called Pythagoreans give two explanations.
Some say that the Milky Way is the path taken by one of the stars at the time
of the legendary fall of Phaethon; others say that it is the circle in which the sun
once moved. And the region is supposed to have been scorched or affected in
some other such way as a result of the passage of these bodies.” See also H. Diels,
Doxographi, pp. 364L = Aetius m.i. (In former times when classical authors were
not yet eagerly prefixed with as many “pseudos” as possible, this was Plutarch,
De placitis 5.1.)</p>
<p>• The Fall of Phaethon</p>
<p>2 5 3</p>
<p>The Pythagoreans were neither idle storytellers, nor were they
even mildly interested in unusual sensational “catastrophes” caused
by meteors, and the like. Actually, the Egyptian priest said to Solon,
concerning the legend of Phaethon, “the story current also in your
part of the world.” Where, then, is the story in Egypt- Since the
Egyptian cosmological language was more technical, in the old
sense, than that of the Greeks, it will take some time to find out
the exact parallel. Anyhow, in Egypt the down-hurled Phaethon
would have been termed “the lost eye,” or rather one among the
“lost eyes.” The eye was “lost” in the so-called “mythical source
of the Nile,” the source of all waters. So it is surprising that Ovid
knew (Met. 2.254ft.) that because of Phaethon’s fall, “Nile ran in
terror to the end of the earth to hide its head which now is still
unseen.” 5 Leaving the Egyptian case for the time being, it is appro¬
priate here to cite two widely separated survivals concerned with
the Phaethon theme. They are useful because they come from
points far removed from the Greek landscape and consequently
cannot be connected with any local catastrophes which are sup¬
posed to have made such a tremendous impression on the Greek
mind. The Fiote of the African Loango Coast, already mentioned,
say: “The Star Way [Galaxy] is the road for a funeral procession
of a huge star which, once, shone brighter from the sky than the
Sun.” 6 Conveniently short, and no technicalities. The Northwest
American version is broader. Because of the absence of chariots in
pre-Columbian America, 7 the Phaethon figure of the Bella Coola
Indians, who had come to visit his father Sun by means of an
arrow-chain, wants to carry Sun’s torches in his stead. Helios agrees,
but he warns his son not to make mischief and burn people. “In
the morning,” he says, “I light one torch, slowly increasing their
number until high-noon. In the afternoon I put them out again
little by little.” The next morning, “Phaethon,” climbing the path
of the Sun, not only kindled all the torches he had, he did so much
too early, so that the earth became red hot: the woods began to</p>

<p>burn, the rocks split, many animals jumped into the waters, but the
waters began to boil, too. “Young woman,” the mother of the Bella
Coola Phaethon, covered men with her coat and succeeded in sav¬
ing them. But Father Sun hurled his offspring down to earth, telling
him: “From now on you shall be the Mink!” 8</p>
<p>It is necessary to revive some other very ancient ideas lost to our
time. That Eridanus was the river Po in northern Italy was a com¬
mon and simple notion in the Greece of Euripides. In one of his
great tragedies (Hippolytus ), the chorus yearns for a flight away
from the world of guilt, to mountains and clouds, to lands far off:</p>
<p>Where the waters of Eridanus are clear
And Phaethon&quot;s sad sisters by his grave
Weep into the water , and each tear
Gleams , a drop of amber , in the waves.</p>
<p>Any hearer would have understood that Phaethon’s sad sisters
were the poplars lining the banks of the river, and that the “drop
of amber” was an allusion to the riches of the “amber route” which
led from the Baltic Sea to the familiar reaches of the Adriatic. So
far so good. But what can be made of Strabo, a still later author
(j.215) who called Eridanus “nowhere on earth existing” and thus
referred clearly to the constellation Eridanus in heaven, and what
does Aratus (360) mean when he talks of “those poor remains of
Eridanus” because the river was “burnt up through Phaethon’s
fall.” Is this the very same river, ample and lined with poplars,
which runs into the delta of the Po?</p>
<p>Apollonios of Rhodes, in recounting the heroic travels of the
Argonauts, carefully preserved the double level of meaning, for the
adventures are set in an earthly context, yet they make, geographi¬
cally speaking, no sense at all. The explorers do sail up the Po,
where they are confronted, as was said, with the stench of Phae-</p>
<p>8 W. Krickeberg, Indicinermdrchen aas Nordamerika (1924), pp. 224L, 396. Cf. E.
Selcr, Gesammelte Abhandlungeii, vol. p. 19. A mere mink might appear to us,
today, as insignificant, like the tapir, or as the “Mouse-Apollo”—we fall for mere
“words” and “names” only too easily. This particular Mink introduces the tides,
steals the fire, fights with the “winds,” playing Adapa, Prometheus, Phaethon all
at the same time.</p>
<p>-33</p>
<p>• The Fall of Fhaethon</p>
<p>thon&rsquo;s remains—but those might be located higher up in a waterfall
in the Alps, near the Dammastock. as one distinguished scholar
would like to suggest. For the Argo moves from the Po into Lake
Geneva and the Rhone, goes down it to the sea again and sails out
following the same longitude; then, by a considerable feat of por¬
tage crosses the Sahara all the way to the coast of West Africa, and
reaches Fernando Po. This is at least how those who understand
the text as geography read it without blinking. Surely, it is closer
to common sense to treat Eridanus as a feature of the skies, where
it is already clearly marked together with Argo; and to treat the
other features accordingly will give at least a significant story, al¬
though it will not dispel the mystery of the Argonauts.</p>
<p>Thus tradition holds that after the dreadful fall of Phaethon. and
when order was re-established. Jupiter ‘‘catasterized&quot; Phaethon,
that is. placed him among the stars, as Auriga (Greek Heniochos
and Erichthonios); and at the same time Eridanus was catasterized.
Manilius hinted at this event only with the lines “The world took
fire, and in new kindled stars / the bright remembrance of its fate
it bears.” Xonnos gave a more detailed report (3S. 424-31) : 9 10</p>
<p>But father Zeus fixed Phaethon in Olympus, like a charioteer, and
bearing that name. As he holds in the radiant Chariot of the heavens
with shining arm. he has the shape of a Charioteer starting upon his
course, as if even among the stars he longed again for his father’s car.
The fire-scorched river also came up to the vault of the stars with
consent of Zeus, and in the starry circle rolls the meandering stream
of burning Eridanus.</p>
<p>Now, in times when myth was still a serious form of thought,
objects were not identified in heaven which did not belong there
in the first place. The problem which arose later is the one raised
by Richard H. Allen, who remarks that “the Milky Wav was
long known as Eridanus. the Stream of Ocean,”' 0 and by the
translator of Xonnos. W. PL D, Rouse, who shortly annotated
Eridanus as “the Milky Way.&quot; It takes some nerve to say of the</p>

<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 256</p>
<p>Galaxy that it meanders—actually the Greek text has it that it
moves like a helix (helissetai ). But apart from this incongruent
image of the “helixing” Milky Way, the myth of Phaethon was
meant by the Pythagoreans to tell of the departure of the Sun and
planets from their former path, and the enthroning of Eridanus,
which together with Auriga was to take over the function of the
Milky Way: that is why they were “catasterized” together. Ad¬
mittedly, one faces a frightening confusion between the rivers in
heaven and those on earth, and the names which were given to both
kinds of streams, but with patience the threads can be disentangled.</p>
<p>Taking the rivers of our globe first, it was not only the Po that
received the name of Eridanus, but the Rhone, 11 and the Nile and
the Ganges. Finally in Higgins’ Anacalypsis there is a quote, with¬
out the ancient source but reasonably reliable: “Ganges which also
is called Po.” 12 Thus it is not surprising that much later, in medieval
times, several redactions of the Alexander Romance show different
opinions about the river used by the king to travel to paradise in
order to win immortality. In a French prose novel of the 14th
century Alexander sails the Nile upstream, whereas in a Latin ver¬
sion of the 12th century, he uses the Ganges: as the Indians had told
him, the Ganges had its source in paradise. 13 So have, indeed, all
great rivers of myth.</p>
<p>In the sky, the number of candidates for election is three. Besides
the Milky Way, Eratosthenes’ authoritative Catasterisms called the
constellation Eridanus Nile or Ocean. 14 But the astrologers Teukros
and Valens listed Eridanus among the paranatellonta of Aquarius.
Paranatellonta are the constellations that “rise at the same time” as
a given one, i.e., in this instance, as Aquarius. That is, they called
the gush from the jug of Aquarius Eridanus. More awkward still,</p>

of Eridanus being in India, see O. Gruppe, Griechische Mythologie (1906), p. 394,
referring to Ktesias.</p>

<p>257 ' The Fall of Phaethon</p>
<p>this gush from Aquarius’ jar was meant to join our constellation
Eridanus below Piscis Austrinus. 15 Says Manilius (/ .43 8ff.):</p>
<p>Next swims the Southern Fish, which bears a Name
From the South-Wind, and spreads a feeble Flame.</p>
<p>To him the Flouds in spacious windings turn
One fountain flows from cold Aquarius' Urn;</p>
<p>And meets the other where they ]oyn their Streams
One Chanel keep, and mix the starry Beams.</p>
<p>Eratosthenes’ Catasterisms bring one more complication into the
picture, but it is one which leads, finally, to the decisive insight.
Differing from those of Aratus (36of.) and from Ptolemy, it counts
Canopus in the constellation Eridanus, instead of Argo, and thus
gives the river a different direction. 16 The whole “Gordian knot” of
misapprehensions hinges upon the name Eridanus, and one can do
nothing better than to follow the good example set by Alexander
and “pull out the pole pin.” Eridanus, lacking a decent Greek
etymology, finds a reasonable derivation from Eridu, as was pro¬
posed by Kugler, Eridu being the seat of Enki-Ea, Sumerian
mul NUN ki = Canopus (alpha Carinae) . n Eridu marked, and meant,
the “confluence of the rivers,” a topos of highest importance, to
which, beginning with Gilgamesh, the great “heroes” go on a
pilgrimage trying in vain to gain immortality—including Moses
according to the 18th Sura of the Koran. Instead of this unobtain¬
able boon, they gain “the measures,” as will be seen. “Eridu” being
known as the “confluence of the rivers,” Eridanus had to join, by
definition so to speak, some “river” somewhere in the South, or it
had to flow straightaway into Eridu-Canopus, as the Catasterisms
claimed. There have been more drastic “solutions” still. The first is
given by Servius (to Aeneid 6.6$ 9) who pretends Eridanus and</p>

<p>Phaethon were one and the same. 18 The second, presented by
Michael Scotus, 19 agrees with Servius concerning the identity of
Phaethon and Eridanus, but does much more. He places into the
“sign” Eridanus the “Figura sonantis Canoni”—consisting of seven¬
teen stars—which he calls Canopus and claims that Canopus touches
Argo. And about this enigmatic personage Scotus says that he “hin¬
dered the work of the Sun by the tone of his lute, because the
horses listened to it, and enraged Jupiter pierced him with the
lightning.” 20</p>
<p>Eridanus was understood by the astrologers to be the whirlpool
(zalos ), as has been seen, flowing through the underworld with
its many realms, including those from which one sees the celestial
South Pole. Virgil wrote in the Georgies (/.242^): “One pole is
ever high above us, while beneath our feet is seen the other, of black
Styx and the shades infernal.” But why was Auriga catasterized at
the same time as Eridanus, and what is the “function” which these
two constellations had to take over from the Milky Way? The
Galaxy was and remains the belt connecting North and South,
above and below. But in the Golden Age, when the vernal equinox
was in Gemini, the autumnal equinox in Sagittarius, the Milky
Way had represented a visible equinoctial colure; a rather blurred
one, to be true, but the celestial North and South were connected
by this uninterrupted broad arch which intersected the ecliptic at
its crossroads with the equator. The three great axes were united,
the galactic avenue embracing the “three worlds” of the gods, the
living and the dead. This “golden” situation was gone, and to Eri¬
danus was bequeathed the galactical function of linking up the
“inhabited world” with the abode of the dead in the (partly) invis¬
ible South. Auriga had to take over the northern obligations of the</p>

<p>Galaxy, connecting the inhabited world with the region of the
gods as well as possible. There was no longer a visible continuous
bond fettering together immortals, living and dead: Kronos alone
had lived among men in glorious peace.</p>
<p>And here there is a proposition to be made. In order to evaluate it,
one has to consider the fact that alpha Aurigae is Capella, the Goat.
This remarkable figure was the nurse of infant Zeus in the Dictaean
Cave, and out of her skin Hephaistos was later to make the Aegis:
Amaltheia. Capella-Amaltheia’s Horn was the Horn of Plenty for
the immortals, and the source of Nectar and Ambrosia. Mortals
called it “second table,” dessert so to speak. 21 But there are two
shreds of Orphic tradition which seem to be revealing, both handed
down to us by Proclus. The first says that Demeter separated the
food of the gods, splitting it up, as it were, into a liquid and a solid
“part,” that is, into Ambrosia and Nectar. 22 The second declares
that Rhea became Demeter after she had borne Zeus. 23 And Eleusis,
for us a mere “place name,” was understood by the Greeks as
“Advent”—the New Testament uses the word for the Advent of
Christ. Demeter, formerly Rhea, wife of Kronos, when she “ar¬
rived,” split up the two kinds of divine food having its source in
alpha Aurigae. In other words, it is possible that these traditions
about Demeter refer to the decisive shifting of the equinoctial
colure to alpha Aurigae.</p>
<p>But one should also look at some other traditions. Turning to
India, which is often helpful in its abundance, it was the Ganges
that stood for the Galaxy, almost as a matter of course, 24 but the
Mahabharata and the Puranas tell at least how the link was con¬
ceived: Ganga was born of the Milky Way. Says the Vishnu
Pur ana: 25</p>

<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 260</p>
<p>I l iving the source in the nail of the great toe of Vishnu’s left foot,
Dhruva (Polaris) receives her, and sustains her day and night devoutly
on his head; and thence the seven Rishis practise the exercise of
austerity in her waters, wreathing their braided locks with her waves.
The orb of the moon, encompassed by her accumulated current,
derives augmented lustre from this contact. Falling from on high,
as she issues from the moon, she alights on the summit of Meru (the
World Mountain in the North), and thence flows to the four quarters
of the earth, for its purification . . . The place whence the river pro¬
ceeds, for the purification of the three worlds, is the third division
of the celestial regions, the seat of Vishnu.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, a colossal event to have “the stream Air-Ganges
fall down from Heaven,” and its violence was only restrained by
Shiva’s receiving it in the curls of his hair. One might add that he
bore it there “for more than 100 years, to prevent it from falling
too suddenly upon the mountain.” The Indian imagination is free¬
wheeling, and cares little for time sequence, but it is clear that the
flow is perpetual. Were it not for Shiva’s hair acting as a catch¬
ment, the earth would have been flooded by the Waters Above.
They come, as was just quoted, from the third region of the sky,
the “path of Vishnu” between Ursa Major and the Pole Star. Wil¬
son stated in 1840: “The situation of the sources of the Ganges in
heaven identifies it with the Milky Way.” 26</p>
<p>But if the flow is perpetual, it still had a point of “beginning” and
this is found in the Bhagavata Purana (Wilson, p. 138, n. 11):
“The river flowed over the great toe of Vishnu’s left foot, which
had previously, as he lifted it up, made a fissure in the shell of the
mundane egg, and thus gave entrance to the heavenly stream.” How
can the Milky Way pour its waters over Polaris? And how can it</p>
<p>26 The Chinese report as given by Gustave Schlegel (UUranographie Chinoise
[1875; repr. 1967], p. 20) is shorter but it points to the same fanciful conception.
“La fleuve celeste se divise en deux bras pres du pole Nord et va de la jusqu’au
pole Sud. Un de ses bras passe par l’asterisme Nan-teou (lambda Sagittarii), et
l’autre par 1 ’asterisme Toung-tsing (Gemeaux). Le fleuve est l’eau celeste, coulant
a travers les cieux et se precipitant sous la terre.”</p>
<p>Nan-teou is the “Southern Bushel”: mu lambda phi sigma tau zeta Sagittarii; the
Northern Bushel = the Big Dipper.</p>
<p>Although we agree with Phyllis Ackerman’s view (in Forgotten Religions [1950],
p. 6): “The Nile, however, (like many, if not all sacred rivers originally—com¬
pare the Ganges) is the earthly&quot; continuation of the Milky Way,” we maintain
that the mere recognition does not help to restore sense and meaning to the myth.</p>
<p>2 61 • The Fall of Phaethon</p>
<p>flow to the four quarters of the earth? Indian diagrams remained
fanciful, in the same way as Western medieval ones. It takes some
time for one who looks at the great tympanon at Yezelay to realize
that here is a space-time diagram, as it were, of world history cen¬
tered on the figure of Christ. The effect is all the greater for the
transpositions. It was not wholly absurd, either, for archaic cos¬
mology to have double locations, one. for instance, on the ecliptic
and one circumpolar. If Tezcatlipoca drilled fire at the pole to
“kindle new stars,’’ if the Chinese Saturn had his seat there too, so
could Vishnu’s toe have bilocation: one “above&quot; in the third region,
the other in beta Orionis-Rigel (the Arabian word for “foot&quot;), the
“source” of Eridanus. (And might not Rigel-the-source stand also
for Oervandil’s Toe, catasterized by Thor?) For Rigel marked the
way to Hades in the tradition of the Maori of New Zealand as well
as in the Book of Hermes Trismegistos.</p>
<p>Fanciful, assuredly, but neither the real .Milky Way nor the ter¬
restrial Ganges offered any basis for the imagery of a river flowing
to the four quarters of the earth “for the purification of the three
worlds.” One cannot get away from the “implex” and it is now
necessary to consider the tale of a new skeleton map, alias skambha:
the equinoctial colure had shifted to a position where it ran through
stars of Auriga and through Rigel. Skavibha, as we have said, was
the World Tree consisting mostly of celestial coordinates, a kind
of wildly imaginative armillary sphere. It all had to shift when one
coordinate shifted.</p>
<p>There are stylistic means other than “catasterizations,” that is.
being promoted to heaven among the constellations, to describe
changed circumstances in the sky. Thus, a Babylonian cuneiform
tablet states: “The Goat-Star is also called the witch-star; the
divine function of Tiamat it holds in its hands.” The Goat-Star
( mul UZA = enzu), apart from representing Venus, “rises together
with Scorpius” and has been identified with Vega. 27 If one can rely
on this identification, it seems to describe the situation as seen from
across the sky: the shifting from Sagittarius to Scorpius, and Vega</p>
<p>27 Gossmann, 145; van der W’aerden, JXES S, p. :o.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 262</p>
<p>taking over the northern part of the “function” of the Galaxy.
That Tiamat is the Milky Way, and no “Great Mother” in the
Freudian sense, any more than Ganga, Anahita and others, seems by
now obvious. And the same is true of Egyptian Nut , 28 but the
story has different terms there: Mother Nut is changed into a cow
and ordered to “carry Ra.” (It is, by the way, a “new” Ra: the
older Ra made it quite clear that he wanted to retire for good,
going somewhere “where nobody could reach” him) (appendix #21).</p>
<p>28 The Arabian name of the Galaxy is sufficiently tale-telling: “Mother of the
Sky” (u??i as-sania), and in northern Ethiopia it is called “Em-hola,” i.e., “Mother
of the Bend [Mutter der Kruemmung].” See E. Littmann, “Sternensagen und As-
trologisches aus Nordabessinien,” ARW n (1908), p. 307; Ideler, p. 78.</p>
