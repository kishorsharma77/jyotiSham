  <p>A 1 suo aspetto tal dentro mi fei
Qual si fe' Glauco nel gustar delTerba
Che il fe' consorro in mar degli altri dei.</p>
<p>Dante, Pjradiso i .6-</p>
<p>w</p>
<p>V V hat a max has to say in the last hours of his life deserves
attention. Most especially if that man be Socrates, awaiting execu¬
tion in his jail and conversing with Pythagorean friends. He has
already left the world behind, has made his philosophical will and
is now quietly communing with his own truth. This is the close of
the Pkaedo ( io~D— 115.x). and it is expressed in the form of a myth.
Strangely enough, innumerable commentators have not taken the
trouble to scrutinize it. and have been content to extract from it
some pious generalities about the rewards of the soul. Yet it is a
thoughtful and elaborate statement, attributed to an authority
whom Socrates (or Plato) prefers not to name. It is clothed in a
strange ph ysical garb. It is worth accepting Plato&rsquo;s suggestion to
take it with due attention. Socrates is quietly moving into the other
world, he is a denizen of it already, and his words stand, as it were,
for a rite of passage:</p>
<p>“The story goes that when a man dies his guardian deity, to whose lot
it fell to watch over the man while he was alive, undertakes to con¬
duct him to some place where those who gather must submit their
cases to judgment before journeying to the other world; and this they
do with the guide to whom the task has been assigned of taking them
there. When they have there met with their appropriate fates and
waited the appropriate time, another guide brings them back here
again, after many long cycles of time. The journey, then, is not as
Aeschylus' Telephys describes it: he says that a single track leads to</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill •</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>the other world, but I don’t think that it is ‘single’ or ‘one’ at all.
If it w ere, there would be no need of guides; no one would lose the
way, if there were only one road. As it is, there seem to be many
partings of the way and places where three roads meet. I say this,
judging by the sacrifices and rites that are performed here. The
orderly and wise soul follows on its way and is not ignorant of its
surroundings; but that which yearns for the body, as I said before,
after its long period of passionate excitement concerning the body
and the visible region, departs only after much struggling and suffer¬
ing, taken by force, with great difficulty, by the appropriate deity.
When it arrives where the others are, the unpurified soul, guilty of
some act for which atonement has not been made, tainted with
w icked murder or the commission of some other crime which is akin
to this and w r ork of a kindred soul, is shunned and avoided by every¬
one, and no one will be its fellow r -traveller or guide, but all by itself
it wanders, the victim of every kind of doubt and distraction, until
certain periods of time have elapsed, and wffien they are completed, it
is carried perforce to its appropriate habitation. But that soul which
has spent its life in a pure and temperate fashion finds companions
and divine guides, and each dw r ells in the place that is suited to it.
There are many wonderful places in the w r orld, and the world itself
is not of such a kind or so small as is supposed by those who generally
discourse about it; of that a certain person has convinced me.”</p>
<p>“How do you mean, Socrates?” asked Simmias. “I too have heard a
great deal about the w r orld, but not the doctrine that has found favour
with you. I w r ould much like to hear about it.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t think it requires the skill of a Glaucus 1 to relate my
theory; but to prove that it is true would be a task, I think, too dif¬
ficult for the skill of Glaucus. In the first place I wrould probably not
even be capable of proving it, and then again, even if I did know how
to, I don’t think my lifetime would be long enough for me to give
the explanation. There is, however, no reason why I should not tell
you about the shape of the earth as I believe it to be, and its various
regions.”</p>
<p>“That will certainly do,” said Simmias.</p>
<p>“I am satisfied,” he said, “in the first place that if it is spherical and
in the middle of the universe, it has no need of air or any other force
of that sort to make it impossible for it to fall; it is sufficient by itself
to maintain the symmetry of the universe and the equipoise of the</p>
<p>1 Whoever this (unidentified) Glaucus is, he has nothing to do with the Glaucus
of Anthedon mentioned in the epigraph, a fisherman who on eating a certain plant
was overtaken by a transmutation and threw himself into the sea where he became
a marine god.</p>
<p>181 • Socrates' Last Tale</p>
<p>earth itself. A thing which is in equipoise and placed in the midst of
something symmetrical will not be able to incline more or less
towards any particular direction; being in equilibrium, it will remain
motionless. This is the first point,” he said, “of which I am con¬
vinced !” 2</p>
<p>“And quite rightly so,” said Simmias.</p>
<p>“And again, I am sure that it is very big,” he said, “and that we who
live between the Phasis river and the pillars of Hercules inhabit only
a small part of it, living round the coast of the sea like ants or frogs
by a pond, while many others live elsewhere, in many similar regions.
All over the earth there are many hollows of all sorts of shape and
size, into which the water and mist and air have collected. The earth
itself is a pure thing lying in the midst of the pure heavens, in which
are the stars; and most of those who generally discourse about such
things call these heavens the ‘ether.’ They say that these things I have
mentioned are the precipitation of the ‘ether’ and flow continually
into the hollows of the earth. We do not realize that we are living in
the earth’s hollows, and suppose that we are living up above on the
top of the earth — just as if someone living in the middle of the sea¬
bed were to suppose that he was living on the top of the sea, and
then, noticing the sun and the stars through the water, were to
imagine that the sea was sky; through sluggishness and weakness he
might never have reached the top of the sea, nor by working his way
up and popping up out of the sea into this region have observed how
much purer and more beautiful it is than theirs; nor even heard about
it from anyone who had seen it. That is exactly what has happened
to us: we live in a hollow in the earth, but suppose that we are living
on top of it; and we call the air sky, as though this were the sky, and
the stars moved across it. But the truth of the matter is just the same
—through weakness and sluggishness we are not able to pass through
to the limit of the air. If anyone could climb to the air’s surface, or
grow wings and fly up, then, as here the fishes of the sea pop their
heads up and see our world, so he would pop his head up and catch
sight of that upper region; and if his nature were such that he could
bear the sight, he would come to realize that that was the real sky and
the real light and the real earth. This earth of ours, and the stones,
and all the region here is corrupted and corroded, just as the things
in the sea are corroded by the brine; and in the sea nothing worth
mentioning grows, and practically nothing is perfect—there are just
caves and sand and indescribable mud and mire, wherever there is</p>
<p>2 Thus far, this is Anaximander and his Principle of Sufficient Reason. But we
cannot draw further conclusions: Socrates is, here, deep in his own myth already,
and far beyond Ionian physics which, in his opinion, ought not to be taken
seriously.</p>
<p>11 am let’s Mill • 182</p>
<p>earth too, and there is nothing in any way comparable with the
beautiful things of our world; but those things in the upper world, in
their turn, would be seen far to surpass the things of our world. If it
is a good thing to tell a story then you should listen, Simmias, and
hear what the regions on the earth beneath the sky are really like.”</p>
<p>“We should certainly very much like to hear this story, Socrates,”
said Simmias.</p>
<p>“In the first place, then, my friend, the true earth is said to appear to
anyone looking at it from above like those balls which are made of
twelve pieces of leather, variegated, a patchwork of colours, of which
the colours that we know here—those that our painters use—are sam¬
ples, as it were. There the whole earth is made of such colours, and
of colours much brighter and purer than these: part of it is purple,
of wondrous beauty, and part again golden, and all that part which is
white is whiter than the whiteness of chalk or snow; and it is made
up of all the other colours likewise, and of even more numerous and
more beautiful colours than those that we have seen. Indeed these
very hollows of the earth, full of water and of air, are said to present
a kind of colour as they glitter amid the variety of all the other
colours, so that the whole appears as one continuous variegated pic¬
ture. And in this colourful world the same may be said of the things
that grow up—trees and flowers and all the fruits; and in the same
way again the smoothness and transparency and colours of the stars
are more beautiful than in our world. Our little stones, these highly
prized ones, sards and jaspers and emeralds and so on, are but frag¬
ments of those there; there, they say, everything is like this, or even
more beautiful than these stones that we possess. The reason is that
the stones there are pure, and not corroded or corrupted, as ours are,
by rust and brine, as a result of all that has collected here, bringing
ugliness and diseases to stones and to soil, and to animals and to plants
besides. The earth itself, they say, is ornamented with all things, and
moreover with gold and silver and all things of that sort. They are
exposed to view on the surface, many in number and large, all over
the earth, so that the earth is a sight for the blessed to behold. There
are many living creatures upon it, including men; some live inland,
some live round about the borders of the air as we do on the coasts
of the sea, while others again live on islands encompassed by air near
the mainland. In a word, what the water and the sea are to us, for our
purposes, the air is to them; and what the air is to us, the ‘ether’ is to
them. Their climate is such that they are free from illnesses, and live
much longer than the inhabitants of our world, and surpass us in sight
and hearing and wisdom and so on, by as much as the pureness of
air surpasses that of water, and the pureness of ‘ether’ surpasses that
of air. Moreover they have groves and temples sacred to the gods, in</p>
<p>183 • Socrates' Last Tale</p>
<p>which the gods really dwell, and utterances and prophesies and visions
of the gods; and other such means of intercourse are for them direct
and face to face. And they see the sun and moon and stars as they
really are, and their blessedness in other respects is no less than in
these.</p>
<p>“This is the nature of the earth as a whole, and of the regions round
about it, and in the earth, in the cavities all over its surface, are many
regions, some deeper and wider than that in which we live, others
deeper but with a narrower opening than ours, while others again are
shallower than this one and broader. All of these are connected with
each other by underground passages, some narrower, some wider—
bored through in many different places; and they have channels along
which much water flows, from one region to another, as into mixing-
bowls; and they have, too, enormous ever-flowing underground
rivers and enormous hot and cold springs, and a great deal of fire,
and huge rivers of fire, and many rivers also of wet mud, some clearer,
some denser, like the rivers of mud that flow before the lava in Sicily,
and the lava itself; and they fill the several regions into which, at any
given time, they happen to be flowing. They are all set in motion,
upwards and downwards, by a sort of pulsation within the earth.
The existence of this pulsation is due to something like this: one of
the chasms of the earth is not only the biggest of them all, but is
bored right through the earth—the one that Homer meant, when he
said that it is Very far off, where is the deepest abyss of all below
the earth.’ Homer elsewhere—and many other poets besides—have
called this Tartarus. Now into this chasm all the rivers flow together,
and then they all flow back out again; and their natures are deter¬
mined by the sort of earth through which they flow. The reason why
all these streams flow out of here and flow in is this, that this fluid
has no bottom or resting place: it simply pulsates and surges upwards
and downwards, and the air and the wind round about it does the
same; they follow with it, whenever it rushes to the far side of the
earth, and again whenever it rushes back to this side, and as the breath
that men breathe is always exhaled and inhaled in succession, so the
wind pulsates in unison with the fluid, creating terrible, unimaginable
blasts as it enters and as it comes out. Whenever the water withdraws
to what we call the lower region, the streams flow into the regions
on the farther side of the earth and fill them, like irrigating canals;
and whenever it leaves those parts and rushes back here, it fills the
streams here afresh, and they when filled flow through their several
channels and through the earth, and as each set of streams arrives at
the particular regions to which its passages lead, it creates seas and
marshes and rivers and springs; and then, sinking back again down
into the earth, some encircling larger and more numerous regions,
others fewer and smaller, these streams issue back into Tartarus again</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 184</p>
<p>—some of them at a point much lower down than that from which
they were emitted, others only a little lower, but all flow in below
the place from which they poured forth. Some flow into the same
part of Tartarus from which they sprang, some into the part on the
opposite side; and others again go right round in a circle, coiling
themselves round the earth several times like snakes, before descend¬
ing as low as possible and falling back again.</p>
<p>“It is possible to descend in either direction as far as the centre, but
not beyond, for the ground on either side begins to slope upwards in
the face of both sets of streams.</p>
<p>“There are many large streams of every sort, but among these many
there are four that I would mention in particular. The largest, the
one which flows all round in a circle furthest from the centre, is that
which is called Oceanus; over against this, and flowing in the opposite
direction, is Acheron, which flows through many desert places and
finally, as it flows under the earth, reaches the Acherusian lake, where
the souls of most of the dead arrive and spend certain appointed
periods before being sent back again to the generations of living
creatures. The third of these rivers issues forth between these two,
and near the place where it issues forth it falls into a vast region
burning with a great fire, and forms a marsh that is larger than our
sea, boiling with water and mud. Thence it makes its way, turbulent
and muddy, and as it coils its way round inside the earth it arrives,
among other places, at the borders of the Acherusian lake, but it does
not mix with the water of the lake; and having coiled round many
times beneath the earth, it flows back at a lower point in Tartarus.
This is the river they call Pyriphlegethon, and volcanoes belch forth
lava from it in various parts of the world. Over against this, again, the
fourth river flows out, into a region that is terrible and wild, all of a
steely blue-grey colour, called the Stygian region; and the marsh
which the river forms as it flows in is called the Styx. After issuing
into this marsh and receiving terrible powers in its waters, it sinks
down into the earth, and coiling itself round proceeds in the opposite
direction to that of Pyriphlegethon, and then meets it coming from
the opposite way at the Acherusian lake. The water of this river
likewise mixes with no other, but itself goes round in a circle and then
flows back into Tartarus opposite to Pyriphlegethon; and the name
of this river, according to the poets, is Cocytus.</p>
<p>“Such is the nature of the world; and when the dead reach the region
to which their divine guides severally take them, they first stand trial,
those who have lived nobly and piously, as well as those who have
not. And those who are found to have lived neither particularly well
nor particularly badly journey to Acheron, and embarking on such
vessels as are provided for them arrive in them at the lake. There they</p>
<p>185 • Socrates' Last Tale</p>
<p>dwell and are purified; paying due penalties, they are absolved from
any sins that they have committed, and receive rewards for their
good deeds, each according to his merits. Those who are iudged in¬
curable because of the enormity of their crimes, having committed
many heinous acts of sacrilege or many treacherous and abominable
murders or crimes of that magnitude, are hurled by their fitting des¬
tiny into Tartarus, whence they never more emerge. Those who are
judged to be guilty of crimes that are curable but nevertheless great
—those, for example, who having done some act of violence to father
or mother in anger live the rest of their lives repenting of their
wickedness, or who have killed someone in other circumstances of a
similar nature—must fall into Tartarus; but when they have fallen in
and stayed there a year, the wave casts them forth—the murderers
along Cocytus, those who have struck their fathers or mothers along
Pyriphlegethon; and when they are being carried past the Acheru-
sian lake, they shout and cry out to those whom they have murdered
or outraged, and calling upon them beg and implore them to let them
come out into the lake, and to receive them; and if they can prevail
upon them, they come out and cease from their woes, but if not, they
are carried again into Tartarus, and from there once more into the
rivers, and they do not stop suffering this until they can prevail upon
those whom they have wronged, for such is the sentence that the
judges have pronounced upon them. Lastly, those who are found to
have lived exceptionally good lives are released from these regions
within the earth and allowed to depart from them as from a prison,
and they reach the pure dwelling place up above and live on the sur¬
face of the earth; and of these, those who have sufficiently purified
themselves by means of philosophy dwell free from the body for all
time to come, and arrive at habitations even fairer than these, habita¬
tions that it is not easy to describe; and there is not time to make the
attempt now. But for these reasons, Simmias, which we have dis¬
cussed, we should do all in our power to achieve some measure of
virtue and of wisdom during our lives, for great is the reward, and
great the hope.</p>
<p>“No man of sense should affirm decisively that all this is exactly as I
have described it. But that the nature of our souls and of their habita¬
tions is either as I have described or very similar, since the soul is
shown to be immortal—that, I think, is a very proper belief to hold,
and such as a man should risk: for the risk is well worth while. And
one should repeat these things over and over again to oneself, like a
charm, which is precisely the reason why I have spent so long in
expounding the story now.</p>
<p>‘Tor these reasons, then, a man should have no fears about his soul, if
throughout his life he has rejected bodily pleasures and bodily adorn¬
ments, as being alien to it and doing more harm than good, and has</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 186</p>
<p>concentrated on the pleasures of learning, and having adorned his soul
with adornments that are not alien to it, but appropriate—temperance
and justice and courage and freedom and truth—continues to wait,
thus prepared, for the time to come for him to journey to the other
world. As for you, Simmias and Cebes and all you others, you will
make your several journeys later, at an appointed time; but in my
case, as a character in a tragedy might put it, Destiny is already sum¬
moning me; and it is almost time for me to go to the bath. I think it
is better to have a bath before drinking the poison, and not to give
the women the trouble of washing a corpse .” 3</p>
<p>The end has an invincible beauty, calm and serene, already shim¬
mering with immortality, and yet preserving that light skeptical
irony which makes “a man of sense” in this world. It puts the seal
of confidence on what might otherwise be really an incantation
that one repeats to himself in his last moments.</p>
<p>Readers who are insensitive to this magic will be tempted to dis¬
miss the story as so much poetic nonsense. If Socrates, or rather
Plato, is really talking of a system of rivers within the earth, then
he obviously does not understand the first thing about hydraulics,
and he has only let his fancy run wild. But looking again at the
setting, one begins to wonder if he is referring at all to the earth as
we understand it. He mentions a certain place where we live, and
it looks like a marsh in a hollow or maybe like the bottom of a lake,
full of rocks, and caverns, and sand, “and an endless slough of
mud.” The “true earth,” which is like a ball of twelve colored
pieces, is above us, and one may think instinctively that Plato refers
to the upper limits of the stratosphere, but of course he has never
heard of that. He is dealing with “another” world above us, and
although there are some fantasies of lovely landscapes and animals
and gems, it is in the “aether” as the Greeks understood it. It is
above us, and centered like “our” place, whatever that is, on the
center of the universe. There, the celestial bodies have become clear
to the mind, and the gods are visible and present already. If they
have “temples and houses in which they really dwell,” these look
very much like the houses of the zodiac. Although some features
are scrambled for keeping up an impression of the wondrous, one</p>
<p>3 R. S. Bluck trans. (1955), pp. 128-39.</p>
<p>187 ' Socrates' 1 Last Tale</p>
<p>suspects that this is heaven pure and simple. Then comes the un¬
equivocal geometric countersign.</p>
<p>That world is a dodecahedron. This is what the sphere of twelve
pieces stands for: there is the same simile in the Timaeus (55c),
and then it is said further that the Demiurge had the twelve faces
decorated with figures (diazo,graph on) which certainly stand for
the signs of the zodiac. A. E. Taylor insisted rather prosily that
one cannot suppose the zodiacal band uniformly distributed on a
spherical surface, and suggested that Plato (and Plutarch after him)
had a dodecagon in mind and they did not know what they were
talking about. This is an unsafe way of dealing with Plato, and
Professor Taylor’s suffisance soon led him to grief. Yet Plutarch
had warned him: the dodecahedron “seems to resemble both the
Zodiac and the year.”</p>
<p>Is their opinion true who think that he ascribed a dodecahedron to
the globe, when he says that God made use of its bases and the ob¬
tuseness of its angles, avoiding all rectitude, it is flexible, and by
circumtension, like globes made of twelve skins, it becomes circular
and comprehensive. For it has twenty solid angles, each of which is
contained by three obtuse planes, and each of these contains one and
the fifth part of a right angle. Now it is made up of twelve equilateral
and equangular quinquangles (or pentagons), each of which consists
of thirty of the first scalene triangles. Therefore it seems to resemble
both the Zodiac and the year, it being divided into the same number
of parts as these. 4</p>
<p>In other words, it is stereometrically the number 12, also the num¬
ber 30, the number 360 (“the elements which are produced when
each pentagon is divided into 5 isosceles triangles and each of the
latter into 6 scalene triangles”)—the golden section itself. This is
what it means to think like a Pythagorean.</p>
<p>Plato did not worry about future professional critics very much.
He only provided a delectable image, and left them to puzzle it
out. But what stands firm is the terminology. After the Demiurge
had used the first four perfect bodies for the elements, says the
Timaeus, he had the dodecahedron left over, and he used it for the</p>
<p>4 Qnaestiones Platonicae 5.1, 1003c (R. Brown trans.), in Plutarch&rsquo;s Morals , ed.
W. W. Goodwin (1870), vol. 5, p. 433.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 188</p>
<p>frame of the whole. There is no need - to go into the reasons,
geometrical and numerological, which fitted the “sphere of twelve
pentagons,” as it was called, for the role. What counts here: it was
the whole, the cosmos, that was meant. Plato had stood by the origi¬
nal Pythagorean tradition, which called cosmos the order of the
sun, moon and planets with what it comprised. As a free-roving
soul, you can look at it “from above.” (Archimedes in the Sand-
reckoner still uses the term cosmos loosely in that sense, at least by
way of a concession to old usage.)</p>
<p>To conclude: the “true earth” was nothing but the Pythagorean
cosmos, and the rivers that flowed from its surface to the center
and back can hardly be imagined as strictly terrestrial: although
with that curious archaic intrication of earth and heaven which
has become familiar and which makes great rivers flow - from heaven
to earth, it is not surprising to find oneself dealing with “real” fiery
currents like Pyriphlegethon connected with volcanic fire. But
where is Styx? Hardly down here, with its landscape of blue. And
the immense storm-swept abyss of Tartar os is not a cavern under
the ground, it belongs somewhere in “outer” space.</p>
<p>This is all the world of the dead, from the surface down and
throughout. It localizes as poorly as the nether world of the Repub¬
lic. The winding rivers which carry the dead and which go back
on their tracks are suggestive more of astronomy than of hydrau¬
lics. The “seesaw” swinging of the earth (n.b.: it has to be the
“true earth”) might well be the swinging of the ecliptic and the
sky with the seasons. There is no need now to go into the con¬
fusing earthy or infernal details of the description except to note
that Numenius of Apamea, an important exegete of Plato, comes
out flatly with the contention that the other world rivers and Tar-
taros itself are the “region of planets.” But Proclus, an even more
important and learned exegete, comes out flatly against Numenius. 5
Enough is known, indeed more than enough of the welter of orien¬
tal traditions on the Rivers of Heaven with their bewildering mix¬
ture of astronomical and biological imagery, which culminated in
Anaximander’s idea of the “Boundless Flow,” the Apeiron, to see</p>
<p>5 See F. Buffiere, Les Mythes d&rsquo;Homere et la Fensee Grecque (1956), p. 444.</p>
<p>189 • Socrates' Last Tale</p>
<p>whence early Greece got its lore. It can be left alone here. But
Socrates is citing an Orphic version, whence his restraint in naming
his authorities, and its strange entities, such as Okeanos and Chro¬
nos, deserve attention. What is meant here is not Kronos, Saturn,
but really Chronos, Time. As concerns Okeanos, even Jane Harri¬
son, who could hardly be accused of a tendency to search for the
gods somewhere else than on the surface or in the interior of the
earth, had to admit: “Okeanos is much more than Ocean and of
other birth.” 6 In her eyes he is “a daimon of the upper air/’ An im¬
portant concession which may lead a long way.</p>
<p>We bypass for the moment the imposing work of Eisler, Welten-
mantel und Himmelszelt (1910), an inexhaustible lode but one
which provides more information than guidance. Onians’ Origins of
European Thought offers a more recent appraisal. 7 He compares
Okeanos to Acheloiis, the primal river of water that “was con¬
ceived as a serpent with human head and horns.'’ He goes on:</p>
<p>The procreation element in any body was the psyche, which ap¬
peared in the form of a serpent, Okeanos was, as may now be seen,
the primeval psyche and this would be conceived as a serpent in rela¬
tion to procreative liquid . . . Thus we may see, for Homer, who
refers allusively to the conception shared by his contemporaries, the
universe had the form of an egg girt about by “Okeanos, who is the
generation of All” . . . We can perhaps also better understand . . .
why in this Orphic version [Frgs. 54, 57, 58 Kern] the serpent was
called Chronos and why, when asked what Chronos was, Pythagoras
answered that it was the psyche of the universe. According to Phere-
kydes it was from the seed of Chronos that fire and air and water
were produced.</p>
<p>The great Orphic entity was Chronos Aion (the Iranian Zurvan
akarana), commonly understood as “Time Unbounded,” and in
“Aion” Professor Onians sees “the procreative fluid with which the
psyche was identified, the spinal marrow believed to take serpent
form” and it may well be so, since these are timeless ideas which
still live today in ophidic cults and in the “kundalini” of Indian
Yoga. But Aion certainly meant “a period of time,” and age, hence</p>
<p>6 J. E. Harrison, The?nis (i960), pp. 456E</p>
<p>7 P. B. Onians: The Origins of European Thought about the Body, the Mind,
the Soul, the World, Time, and Fate (zd ed. 1953), pp. 249^.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill •</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>“world-age” and later “eternity,” and there is no reason to think
that the biological meaning must have been prior and dominant. It
is known that for the Orphics Chronos was mated to Ananke,
Necessity, which also, according to the Pythagoreans, surrounds
the universe. Time and Necessity circling the universe, this is a
fairly clear and fundamental conception; it is linked with heavenly
motions independently from biology, and it leads directly to Plato’s
idea of time as “the moving image of eternity.”</p>
<p>It would be helpful if historians of archaic thought would first
present straight data, without pressing and squeezing their material
into a shape that reflects their preconceived conclusion, that bio¬
logical images must come first in “primitive” psychology, like all
that is concerned with generation.</p>
<p>If one wants psychology, one can go back to Socrates in a very
different phase of his life, where he is really talking psychology in
the Theaetetus (152E): “When Homer sings the wonder of ‘Ocean
whence sprang the Gods and Mother Tethys,’ does he not mean
that all things are the offspring of flux and motion?” The question
arises, would the ocean be an image of flux except for the tides? But
Socrates’ Aegean had no tides. The image comes to him from
Hesiod’s description of Okeanos (Theogony 79off.): “With nine
swirling streams he winds about the earth and the sea’s wide back,
and then falls into the main; but the tenth flows out from a rock, a
sore trouble to the Gods.” That dreaded tenth is the river of Styx.
Jane Harrison was right. Okeanos is “of another birth” than our
Ocean.</p>
<p>The authority of Berger can reconstruct the image. 8 The at¬
tributes of Okeanos in the literature are “deep-flowing,” “flowing-
back-on-itself,” “untiring,” “placidly flowing,” “without billows.”
These images, remarks Berger, suggest silence, regularity, depth,
stillness, rotation—what belongs really to the starry heaven. Later
the name was transferred to another more earthbound concept: the
actual sea which was supposed to surround the land on all sides.
But the explicit distinction, often repeated, from the “main” shows
that this was never the original idea. If Okeanos is a “silver-swirl-
8 E. H. Berger, Mythische Kosmogrciphie der Griechen (1904), pp. iff.</p>
<p>!9</p>
<p>• Socrates' Last Tale</p>
<p>ing” river with many branches which obviously never were on sea
or land, then the main is not the sea either, pontos or thalassa, it has
to be the Waters Above. The Okeanos of myth preserves these
imposing characters of remoteness and silence. He was the one who
could remain by himself when Zeus commanded attendance in
Olympus by all the gods. It was he who sent his daughters to
lament over the chained outcast Prometheus, and offered his power¬
ful mediation on his behalf. He is the Father of Rivers; he dimly
appears in tradition, indeed, as the original god of heaven in the
past. He stands in an Orphic hymn 9 as “beloved end of the earth,
ruler of the pole,” and in that famous ancient lexicon, the Ety-
mologicum magnum, his name is seen to derive from “heaven.”</p>
