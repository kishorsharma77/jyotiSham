<p>N ow the discussion leaps. without apologies, over the impas¬
sable fence erected by modern philologists to protect the linguistic
family of Indo-European languages from any improper dealings
with strange outsiders. It is known that Finland. Esthonia and Lap-
land are a cultural island, ethnically related to the Hungarians and
to other faraway Asian peoples: Siryenians. Yotyaks. Cheremis-
sians. Mordvinians. Moguls. Ostyaks. They speak languages which
belong to the Ugro-Finnish family, as totally unrelated to Ger¬
manic as Basque would be. These languages are described as &lsquo;‘ag¬
glutinative&quot; and often characterized by vowel harmonization, such
as is found in Turkish. These cultural traditions until quite recently
were segregated from the Scandinavian environment. Even if West¬
ern culture—and Christianity with it—seeped through among the
literati from the Middle Ages on. their great epic, the Kalev j/j,
remained intact, entrusted as it was to oral transmission going back
in unchanged form to very early times. It shows arrestingly primi¬
tive features, so primitive that they discourage any attempt at a
classical derivation. It was collected in writing only in the 19th
century by Dr. Elias Lonnrot. But even in this segregated tradi¬
tion, startling parallels were found with Norse and Celtic myth,
which must go back to times before their respective recorded his¬
tories. The main line of the poem will be dealt with later. Here, it
is important to look at the story of Kullervo Kalevanpoika (&ldquo;the
son of Kaleva&rdquo;). which has been carefully analyzed by E. X.
Setala in his masterly inquiry “Kullervo-Hamlet.” 1 His material is

<p>necessary, as well as that collected by Kaarle Krohn, 2 in order
to take into account many variants (which Lonnrot has not incor¬
porated into the runes 31-36 of the official Kalevala ) dealing with
Kullervo.</p>
<p>The first event is the birth of Kullervo’s father and uncle, who
are, according to rune 31, swans (or chickens), driven from one
another by a hawk. Usually it is told that a poor man, a plowman,
made furrows around a tree trunk (or on a small hill) which split
open, and out of it were born two boys. One of them, Kalervo,
grew up in Carelia, the other, Untamo, in Suomi-Finland. The
hate between the brothers arises usually in the following manner:
Kalervo sows oats before the door of Untamo, Untamo’s sheep eat
them, Kalervo’s dog kills the sheep; or there is a quarrel about the
fishing grounds (rune 31.19ft.). Untamo then produces the war.
In fact, he makes the war out of his fingers, the army out of his
toes, soldiers of the sinews of his heel. But there are versions where
Untamo arms trees and uses them as his army. He kills Kalervo and
all his family, except Kalervo’s wife, who is brought to Untamo’s
home and there gives birth to our hero, Kullervo. The little one
is rocked in the cradle for three days,</p>
<p>when the boy began his kicking,
and he kicked and pushed about him,
tore his swaddling clothes to pieces,
freed himself from all his clothing,
then he broke the lime-wood cradle?</p>
<p>At the age of three months,</p>
<p>when a boy no more than knee-high,
he began to speak in this wise:</p>
<p>“Presently when 1 am bigger,</p>
<p>And my body shall be stronger,</p>
<p>HI avenge my father&rsquo;s slaughter,</p>
<p>2 Kalevalastudien 6. Kullervo (1928).</p>
<p>3 Translated by W. F. Kirby (Everyman’s Library). The original rough meter
has been made to sound like a poor man’s Hiawatha, but it was the original metric
model for Longfellow.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill •</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>And viy mother&rsquo;s tears atone for.&quot;</p>
<p>This &lsquo;was heard by Untamoinen,</p>
<p>And he spoke the r words which follow:</p>
<p>“He will bring my race to ruin,</p>
<p>Kalervo reborn is in him .&quot;</p>
<p>And the old crones all considered,
how to bring the boy to ruin,
so that death might come upon him.</p>
<p>Untamo tries hard to kill the child, with fire, with water, by hang¬
ing. A large pyre is built, Kullervo is thrown into it. When the
servants of Untamo come after three days to look,</p>
<p>knee-deep sat the boy in ashes,
in the embers to his elbows,
in his hands he held a coal-rake,
and was stirring up the fire.</p>
<p>Setala reports a version where the child, sitting in the midst of the
fire, the (golden) hook in his hand, and stirring the fire, says to
Untamo’s servants that he is going to avenge the death of his father. 4
Kullervo is thrown into the sea; after three days they find him sit¬
ting in a golden boat, with a golden oar, or, according to another
version, he is sitting in the sea, on the back of a wave, measuring
the waters</p>
<p>Which perchance might fill two ladles,</p>
<p>Or if more exactly measured,</p>
<p>Partly was a third filled also.</p>
<p>Next, they hang the child on a tree, or a gallows is erected—again
with frustrating results:</p>
<p>Kullervo not yet has perished,</p>
<p>Nor has he died on the gallows .</p>

<p>29 • The Figure in Finland</p>
<p>In his hands he holds a graver.</p>
<p>All the tree is fiUed with pictures,</p>
<p>All the oak-tree filled with carvings.</p>
<p>One tradition says that he is carving the names of his parents
with a golden stylus. After this the sequence of events is difficult
to establish. There are variants, where Kullervo performs his re¬
venge very soon—he merely goes to a smithy and procures the
arms. Or he is at once sent out of the country to the smith to serve
as cowherd and shepherd. But in rune 5/, he is first given smaller
commissions: to guard and rock a child—he blinds and kills it. Then
he is sent to clear a forest, and to fell the slender birch trees.</p>
<p>Five large trees at length had fallen,</p>
<p>Eight in all he felled before him . 5</p>
<p>He sits down afterwards and speaks (31.2738.).</p>
<p>“Le??ipo [the Devil] may the work accomplish,</p>
<p>Hiisi now may shape the timber /”</p>
<p>In a stump he struck his axe-blade,</p>
<p>And began to shout full loudly,</p>
<p>And he piped, and then he whistled,</p>
<p>And he said the words which follow:
u Let the woods be felled around me,</p>
<p>Overthrown the slender birch-trees,</p>
<p>Far as sounds my voice resounding,</p>
<p>Far as I can send my whistle.</p>
<p>Let no sapling here be growing,</p>
<p>Let no blade of grass be standing,</p>
<p>Never while the earth endureth,</p>
<p>5 There is a strange Dindsencha (this word applies to the explanations of place-
names which occur repeatedly in Irish tradition; see W. Stokes, “The Prose Tales
in the Rennes Dindsenchas,” RC 16 , pp. 278f.) about the felling of five giant trees
—three ash trees, one oak, one yew. “The oak fell to the south, over Mag n-Ailte,
as far as the Pillar of the Living Tree. 900 bushels was its crop of acorns, and three
crops it bore every year . . . apples, nuts, and acorns. The ash of Tortu fell to the
South-east, that from Usnach to the North. The yew north-east, as far as Druinn
Bairr it fell. The ash of Belach Dahli fell upwards as far as Carn Uachtair Bile.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill •</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Or the golden moon is shining,</p>
<p>Here in Kalervo&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s forest,</p>
<p>Here upon the good man&rsquo;s clearing .&quot; 6</p>
<p>In the Kalevala, Untamo next orders Kullervo to build a fence,
and so he does, out of whole pines, firs, ash trees. But he made no
gateway into it, and announced:</p>
<p>He who cannot raise him birdlike,</p>
<p>Nor upon two wings can hover,</p>
<p>Never may he pass across it,</p>
<p>Over Kalervo&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s fencing!</p>
<p>Untamo is taken aback:</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a fence without an opening . . .</p>
<p>Up to heaven the fence is builded,</p>
<p>To the very clouds uprising. 7</p>
<p>6 The Esthonian Kalevipoeg (=son of Kaleva, the same as Finnish Kalevan-
poika) makes the soil barren wherever he has plowed with his wooden plow
(Setala, FL T F 7, p. 215), but he, too, fells trees with noise—as far as the stroke of his
axe is heard, the trees fall down (p. 203). As for Celtic tradition, one of the
Rennes Dindsenchas tells that arable land is changed into woodland because
brother had killed brother, “so that a wood and stunted bushes overspread Guaire’s
country, because of the parricide which he committed” (Stokes, RC 16, p. 35).
Whereas J. Loth ( Les Mabinogion du Livre Rouge de Hergest , vol. /, p. 272,
n. 6) gives the names of three heroes who make a country sterile: “Morgan
Mwynvawr, Run, son of Beli, and Llew Llaw Gyffes, who turn the ground red.
Nothing grew for a year, herb or plant, where they passed: Arthur was more
‘rudvawc’ than they. &lsquo;Where Arthur had passed, for seven years nothing would
grow.” Rudvawc means “red ravager,” as we learn from Rachel Bromwich
(Trioedd Ynys Fry dein: The Welsh Triads [1961], p. 35). Seven years was the
cycle of the German Wild Hunter; Arthur was a Wild Flunter, too. The “Waste
Land” is, moreover, a standard motif of the legends spun around the Grail and
the Fisher King. All this will make sense eventually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This might originally have been the same story as the one about Romulus
drawing a furrow around the new city and killing Remus for jumping over it.
In the Roman tradition, the murder makes no sense. Without following up this
key phenomenon here, we would like to say that in Finland the stone labyrinth
(the English “Troy town”) is called Giant’s Fence, and also St. Peter’s Game,
Ruins of Jerusalem, Giant’s Street, and Stone Fence (see W. H. Matthews,
Mazes and Labyrinths , p. 150). Whereas Al-Biruni ( India /, p. 306), when dealing
with Lanka (Ceylon)—i.e., Ravana’s labyrinth that was conquered by Rama and
Hanuman—remarks that in Muslim countries this “labyrinthic fortress is called
Yavana-Koti, which has been frequently explained as Rome.”</p>
<p>31 • The Figure in Finland</p>
<p>Kullervo does some more mischief, threshing the grain to mere
chaff, ripping a boat asunder, feeding the cow and breaking its
horn, heating the bath hut and burning it down—these are the usual
feats of the “Strong Boy’’ (the “Starke Hans’’ of German tales,
who with us became Paul Bunyan). So, finally, he is sent out of the
country, to the house of Ilmarinen the divine smith, as a cowherd.
There is, however, a remarkable variant where it is said that he
was “sent to Esthonia to bark under the fence; he barked one year,
another one, a little from the third; three years he barked at the
smith as his uncle, at the wife [or servant] of the smith as his
daughter-in-law.’’ This sounds strange indeed, and the translator
himself added question marks. There is a still stranger parallel in
the great Irish hero Cuchulainn, a central figure of Celtic myth,
whose name means “Dog of the Smith Culan.” This persistent dog¬
gishness will bear investigation at another point and so will Smith
Ilmarinen himself.</p>
<p>The wife of Ilmarinen (often called Elina, Helena) makes Kul¬
lervo her herdsman, and maliciously bakes a stone into his lunch
bread so that he breaks his knife, the only heirloom left from his
father. A crow then advises Kullervo to drive the cattle into the
marshes and to assemble all the wolves and bears and change them
into cattle. Kullervo said:</p>
<p>“Wait thou, wait thou, whore of Hiisi,</p>
<p>For my father’s knife I&rsquo;m weeping,</p>
<p>Soon wilt thou thyself he weeping.&rdquo; (55.1 zyff.)</p>
<p>He acts on the crow’s advice, takes a whip of juniper, drives the
cattle into the marshes, and the oxen into the thicket.</p>
<p>Half of these the wolves devoured,</p>
<p>To the bears he gave the others,</p>
<p>And he sang the wolves to cattle,</p>
<p>And he changed the bears to oxen.</p>
<p>Kullervo carefully instructs the wolves and the bears on what they
are expected to do, and (jj.isjfi.)</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 32</p>
<p>Then he wade a pipe of cow-bone,</p>
<p>And a whistle made of ox-horn,</p>
<p>From Tuomikki&rsquo;s leg a cow-horn,</p>
<p>And a flute from heel of Kirjo,</p>
<p>Then upon the horn blew loudly,</p>
<p>And upon his pipe made music.</p>
<p>Thrice upon the hill he blew it,</p>
<p>Six times at the pathway&rsquo;s opening.</p>
<p>He drives the “cattle” home, Helena goes to the stables to milk,
and is torn by wolf and bear.</p>
<p>This fierce retaliation gives point to an event that is only a feeble
joke in Saxo’s version. A wolf crosses Hamlet’s path, and he is told
it is a horse. “Why,” he remarks, “in Fengb’s stud there are too
few of that kind fighting.” Saxo tries to explain: “This was a gentle
but witty fashion of invoking a curse upon his uncle’s riches.” It
makes little sense. One suspects here instead an echo of the theme
revealed by Kullervo, who drives home wolves and bears in place
of cattle. The hero’s mastery of wild beasts evokes memories of
classical myth. This has not escaped Karl Kerenyi, 8 whose com¬
ment is useful, although not his line of psychological speculation:
“It is impossible to try to derive Finnish mythology from the Greek,
or conversely. Yet it is also impossible not to notice that Kullervo,
who is the Miraculous Child and the Strong Servant in one, shows
himself at last to be Hermes and Dionysos. He appears as Hermes
in the making of musical instruments tied up with the destruction
of cattle . . . He shows himself as Dionysos in what he does with
wild beasts and with his enemy. It is Dionysos-like behavior—if we
see it through the categories of Greek myth—to make wolves and
bears appear by magic as tame animals, and it is again Dionysos-like
to use them for revenge against his enemy. We recognize with awe
the tragic-ironic tone of Euripides’ Bacchae, when we read the
dramatic scene of the milking of wild beasts. An even closer analogy
is given by the fate of the Etruscan pirates, Dionysos’ enemies, who
are chastised by the intervention of wild animals . . .”</p>
<p>8 K. Kerenyi, “Zum Urkind-Mythologen,” Paideimia i (1940), p. 255.</p>
<p>33 • The Figure in Finland</p>
<p>In rune 5J ; Lonnrot makes Kullervo return to his parents and
brothers and sisters. This is unexpected inasmuch as they have been
killed a number of runes earlier, although the crux of the many
rune songs is that the names of the heroes are far from stable and,
as has already been said, the original order of things is impossible
to reconstruct. But one event stands out. A sister is not at home. On
one occasion the hero meets a maiden in the woods, gathering ber¬
ries. They lie together and realize later in conversing that they are
brother and sister. The maiden drowns herself, but Kullervo’s
mother dissuades him from suicide. So he goes to war, and in so
doing he fulfills his revenge. First he asks the great god Ukko for
the gift of a sword (5^.242!?.).</p>
<p>Then the sword he asked was granted,</p>
<p>And a sax or d of all most splendid,</p>
<p>And he slaughtered all the people,</p>
<p>Untamo&rsquo;s whole tribe xas slaughtered,</p>
<p>Burned the houses all to ashes,</p>
<p>And with flame completely burned therm,</p>
<p>Leaving nothing but the hearthstones,</p>
<p>Sought but in each yard the rowan.</p>
<p>Returning home. Kullervo finds no living soul; all have died. When
he weeps over his mother’s grave, she awakes,</p>
<p>And beneath the mould made answer:</p>
<p>“Still there lives the black dog, Musti,</p>
<p>Go with him into the forest,</p>
<p>At thy side let him attend thee.”</p>
<p>There in the thicket reside the blue forest-maidens, and the mother
advises him to try to win their favor. Kullervo takes the black
dog and goes into the forest, but when he comes upon the spot
where he had dishonored his sister, despair overcomes him, and he
throws himself upon his own sword.</p>
<p>Here at last a point is made explicitly which in other stories
remains a dark hint. There is a sin that Hamlet has to atone for.
The knowledge that Kullervo and his sister killed themselves for</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill •</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>unwitting incest calls to mind the fact that in Saxo the adolescent
Prince is initiated to love by a girl who does not betray him “be¬
cause she happened to be his foster-sister and playmate since child¬
hood.” This seems contrived, as if Saxo had found there a theme
he does not grasp. The theme becomes manifest in King Arthur. It
is ambiguous and elusive, but all the more inexorable in Shakespeare.
Hamlet must renounce his true love, as he has to renounce himself
in his predicament:</p>
<p>“Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?
. . . What should such fellows as I do nawling between earth and
heaven? We are arrant knaves all; believe none of us. Go thy ways
to a nunnery.”</p>
<p>In the play-within-a-play, the Prince feels free to step out of
character:</p>
<p>Lady, shall I lie in your lap?</p>
<p>No, my lord.</p>
<p>I mean, my head upon your lap?</p>
<p>Ay, my lord .</p>
<p>Do you think I meant country matters?</p>
<p>1 think nothing, my lord .</p>
<p>That is a -fair thought to lie between maid&rsquo;s legs .</p>
<p>What is, my lord?</p>
<p>Nothing .</p>
<p>But the die is cast. Ophelia’s suicide by drowning, like Kullervo’s
sister’s, brings about the death of her lover—and of her brother too.
The two aspects join in the final silence. At least Hamlet, ever con¬
scious, has had a chance to describe in despair the insoluble knot
of his guilt:</p>
<p>“I loved Ophelia; forty thousand brothers</p>
<p>could not with all their quantity of love</p>
<p>make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?”</p>
<p>And now Kullervo. Setala’s analysis of the whole parallel goes as
follows:</p>
<p>35 ' The Figure in Finland</p>
<p>As concerns generalities: brother kills brother; one son survives,
who sets his mind on revenge from earliest childhood; the uncle
tries to kill him, but he succeeds in achieving his revenge. As con¬
cerns details: Setala wants to identify the stakes and hooks, which
the hero in all northern versions shapes or carves, sitting at the
hearth—Brjam does it in a smithy—with the golden hook or rake
that little Kullervo, sitting in the middle of the fire, holds in his
hands, stirring the flames. Each hero (including Kullervo in one of
the versions found by Setala) makes it clear that he means to avenge
his father.</p>
<p>With some puzzlement Setala brings out one other point which
will turn out to be crucial later on. In every northern version there
is some dark utterance about the sea. The words are weird. Hamlet
wants to “cut the big ham” with the steering oar; the child Kullervo
is found measuring the depth of the sea with an oar or with a ladle.
Kalevipoeg, the Esthonian counterpart of Kullervo Kalevanpoika,
measures the depth of lakes with his height. Amlodhi-Ambales, sit¬
ting by a bottomless mountain lake, says only: “Into water wind
has come, into water wind will go.”</p>
