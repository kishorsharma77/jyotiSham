  <p>Why w as my breeding ordered and prescribed
As of a person separate to God.</p>

Betrayed, captived. and both my eyes put out. . .

<p>T</p>
<p>-L he story of Samson stands out in the Bible as a grand tissue
of absurdities. Sunday school pupils must long have been puzzled
about his weapon for killing Philistines. But there is much more to
puzzle about (Judges xv):</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>
<p>And he found a new jawbone of an ass. and put forth his hand
and took it. and slew a thousand men therewith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And Samson said, with the jawix&gt;ne of an ass. heaps upon heaps,
with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that
he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place
RamathleTii.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And he was sore athirst, and called on the Lord, and said. Thou
hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and
now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw , and there
came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again,
and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof En-hakTo-re.
which is in LeTii unto this day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines tw enty' years.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The passage lias been bowdlerized in the Revised Version to
make it more plausible, but verse 18 is an unshakable reminder that
this was not an ordinary bone, or even “the place” of it as suggested
recently. For that jaw is in heaven. It was the name given by the
Babylonians to the Hyadcs, which were placed in Taurus as the
“Jaw of the Bull.” If we remember the classic tag “the rainy
Hyadcs” it is because Hyades meant “watery.” In the Babylonian
creation epic, which antedates Samson, Marduk uses the Hyades as
a boomeranglike weapon to destroy the brood of heavenly mon¬
sters. The whole story takes place among the gods. It is known,
too, that Indra’s powerful weapon, Vajra, the Thunderbolt made
of the bones of horse-headed Dadhyank, was not of this earth (see
appendix #19).</p>
<p>The story is so universal that it must be seen as spanning the
globe. In South America, where bulls were still unknown, the
Arawaks, the Tupi, the Quechua of Ecuador spoke of the “jaw of
the tapir,” which was connected with the great god, Hunrakan, the
hurricane, who certainly knows how to slay his thousands. In our
sky, the name of the celestial Samson is Orion, the mighty hunter,
alias Nimrod. He remains such even in China as “War Lord Tsan,”
the huntmaster of the autumn hunt, but the Hyades are changed
there into a net for catching birds. In Cambodia, Orion himself
became a trap for tigers; in Borneo, tigers not being available, pigs
have to substitute; and in Polynesia, deprived of every kind of big
game, Orion is found in the shape of a huge snare for birds. It is this
snare that Maui, creator-hero and trickster, used to catch the Sun-
bird; but having captured it, he proceeded to beat it up, and with
what?—the jawbone of Muri Ranga Whenua, his own respected
grandmother.</p>
<p>If one brings Samson—the biblical Shimshon—back to earth, he
becomes a preposterous character, or rather, no character at all,
except for his manic violence and his sudden passions. It comes as
a shock, after reading that chaotic and whimsical life, to find: “And
he judged Israel twenty years.” For if anyone was bereft of judg¬
ment, it was this berserker. As Frazer remarks, one doubts whether
he particularly adorned the bench. Yet there is a mysterious im-</p>
<p>167 • Samson Under Many Skies</p>
<p>portance to his person. On him was piled a hoard of classic fairy
tales, like “the man whose soul was placed elsewhere” (the ex¬
ternal soul), and the insistent motif of fatal betrayal by women, the
motif of Herakles and Llew Llaw Gyffes. More than that, he is
an incongruous montage of nonhuman functions which could no
longer be put together intelligibly, and were crowded together
with cinematographic haste. Even his feats as a young Herakles, tear¬
ing a lion apart, change over in a flash to the generation of bees
from a carcass, recalling the time-honored bougonia of the fourth
book of Virgil’s Georgies .</p>
<p>Of the many nonsense feats there are some which take particular
relief from the context. Samson was displeased (Judges xiv-xv)
because the wife of his heart, a Philistine, had given away to the
children of her people the meaning of his riddle on the lion: “Out
of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth
sweetness,” so that he was held to pay forfeit for his last bet.</p>
<p>xiv. 19. And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down
to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and
gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle.
And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used
as his friend.</li>
</ol>
<p>xv. 1. But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat
harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go
in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him
to go in.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>And her father said, I verily thought that you hadst utterly hated
her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister
fairer than she? Take her, I pray thee, instead of her to your com¬
panion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless
than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took fire¬
brands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst be¬
tween two tails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the
standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and
also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they an¬
swered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 168</p>
<p>his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up,
and burnt her and her father with fire.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>And Samson said unto them. Though ye have done this, yet will I
be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.</li>
</ol>
<p>8 . And lie smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he
went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.</p>
<p>Leaving the great Shimshon there sitting in the top of the rock,
a brief interlude before he goes out again on his own wayward,
rash and splenetic way to provoke his enemies, one is moved to
reflection.</p>
<p>To catch and corral three hundred foxes, and tie them in pairs
by the tail, just to work off a spite, seems more the daydream of
a juvenile delinquent or a Paul Bunyan or a “Starke Hans” than the
feat of a warrior. It is as if Scripture had remembered that he had
to stand out as a great hunter, but had misplaced the occasion of
his hunts. .After all, lions are not to be found behind every hedge¬
row, and foxes might do, if only to annoy. But we know from Ovid
(Fasti 4,6 31 ff.) that in April, at the feast of Ceres, foxes with burn¬
ing fur were chased through the Circus. This might be the real
context. The modern “fertility rite” explanations are so futile that
it might be more to the point to be reminded of the three hundred
elite “dogs” that Gideon recruited for his band, and which still
stand unexplained. One should also consider a more important occa¬
sion to which attention has been drawn by Felix Liebrecht: the
“Sada-Festival,” during which animals were kindled and chased,
burning, through the whole Iranian countryside. This, however,
would lead back to Firdausi’s Book of Kings, and beyond that to
the whole problem of Kynosoura, that cannot be tackled at this
point because it calls for an examination of all that was implied by
the starting of celestial fires.</p>
<p>But the main theme of the story will appear more clearly if it is
transposed in an utterly different narrative convention, the adven¬
tures of Susanowo the Japanese god. They are found in the Japanese
Scriptures, in this case the Nihongi, compiled about the 8th century
a.d. but going back to unknown times. They are the full equivalent
of what the Bible was in our recent past, and even more, for “this</p>
<p>169 • Samson Under Many Skies</p>
<p>body of legend, folklore to us but credible history to the people of
the archipelago, is tangled in the roots of everything Japanese.”
The quotation is from Post Wheeler, who prepared the latest edi¬
tion of the Japanese mythical corpus. To quote him further: “In
no other land do we find a people’s sacred legend so interknit with
the individual’s daily thoughts and life. Its episodes peer at us from
every nook and byway. The primeval myth of the slaughter of the
Eight-Forked-Serpent by the deity Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male,
brother of Bright-Shiner the Sun-Goddess, is pictured on Japan’s
paper currency. I have seen it produced au grand serieux at Tokyo’s
Imperial Theatre, in the same week as one of Ibsen’s tragedies and a
Viennese light opera.” 1</p>
<p>Most of Hebrew mythology wears the hempen homespun of
peasants and patriarchs from Palestine. Japanese myth bears the
mark of an already refined perverse feudal world, back of which
there is the baroque elegance and fantasy of late Chinese culture.
With this premise, here is the story of the Japanese Samson, Susa-
nowo, whose name means Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male. No better
set of attributes for Mars; he is also officially a god, since his sister
Amaterasu, the sun-goddess, is still today the worshiped ancestor
of the Imperial dynasty; the courtly precedences are neatly estab¬
lished. The hero need no longer masquerade as a boor from the
tribe of Dan who raged in Ashkelon and destroyed himself in Gaza.</p>
<p>Now Susanowo was banished from the sky for having thrown
the hind part of his backward-flayed piebald stallion in the weaving
hall of his sister Amaterasu. These sudden discourteous gestures
seem to be part of the code: Enkidu had thus thrown the hind
quarter of the Bull from Heaven in the face of Ishtar, but here
there is the additional code feature (it is code) of the backward-
flayed animal. Susanowo’s gesture caused the Sun-lady to withdraw
in anger into a cave: the world was plunged into darkness. The
80,000 gods assembled in the Milky Way to take counsel, and at last
came upon a device to coax the Sun out of the cave and end the
great blackout. It was a low-comedy trick, part of the stock-in-</p>
<p>1 P. Wheeler, The Sacred Scriptures of the Japanese (1952), pp. vf.</p>
<p>I Iamlet’s Mill •</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>trade that is used to coax Ra in Egypt, Demeter in Greece (the
so-called Demeter Agelastos or Unlaughing Demeter) and Skadi
in the North—obviously another code device. 2</p>
<p>Now light was restored to the world, but on earth the hero-god
moving out of the darkness had nowhere to lay his head; he wan¬
dered around and succeeded in killing the “Eight-Forked-Serpent,”
thus saving a damsel.</p>
<p>Afterwards he arranged “The Drawing of the Lands,” and the
sowing of more land, giving the islands the shape which they
have now. Finally, Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male, having traveled
about the limits of the sky and the earth, even to the Sky-Upright-
Limiting-Wall, dwelt on Mount Bear-Moor and finally went to the
Lower World, also called the Nether-Distant-Land.</p>
<p>To this his place came a Jason, namely the Kami (Divine Prince)
Great-Land-Master, looking for some helpful device against his
brothers, “the 80 Kami” who had succeeded in killing him several
times (Sky-Producer revived him). Before reaching the house, he
married Susanowo’s daughter, Princess-Forward, and this Medea
was to support him faithfully, so that he survived the different
“stations” which Susanowo had prepared for him 3 as proper guest
rooms: the fire, the snake-house, the centipede-and-wasp-house
(Dostoyevsky’s Svidrigailov must have been a great seer):</p>
<p>Then Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male, having shot a humming arrow
into the midst of a great grass-moor, sent him to fetch it, and when
he had entered the moor, set fire to it on all sides. But when Great-
Land-Master found no place of exit, there came a mouse which said,
“The inside is hollowly hollow; the outside is narrowly narrow.” Even
as it spoke thus, he trod on the spot, and falling into the hollow, hid
himself until the fire had burned over, when the mouse brought him
the humming arrow in its mouth, and the arrow’s feathers were
brought in like manner by its young ones.</p>
<p>2 The obscene dance of old Baubo, also called Iambe in Eleusis, parallels the
equally unsavory comic act of Loke in the Edda . The point in all cases is that the
deities must be made to laugh (cf. also appendix #36).</p>
<p>3 For a comparison of the sequence of troublesome caves, holes, or “houses” that
heroes of the Old World as well as of the New World have to pass through, see L.
Frobenius, Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes (1904), pp. 37if.</p>
<p>• Savison Under Many Skies</p>
<p>l 7 l</p>
<p>Now his wife, Princess-Forward, weeping, made preparation for the
funeral, and her father, deeming Great-Land-Master dead, went out
and took stand on the moor, but he found his guest standing there,
who brought the arrow and gave it to him. Then the great Kami
Susanowo took him into the palace and into a great-spaced room,
where he made Great-Land-Master pick the lice from his head,
among which were many centipedes. His wife, however, gave him
aphananth berries and red earth, and he chewed up the berries and
spat them out with the red earth which he held in his mouth, so that
the great Kami, believing him to be chewing and spitting out the
centipedes, began to feel a liking for him in his heart and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Then Great-Land-Master bound Brave-Swift-Impetuous-A tale’s hair
fast to the palace rafters, and blocking up the door with a five-hun¬
dred-man-lift rock, took his wife Princess-Forward on his back,
possessed himself of the Kami’s great life-preserving sword, his bow-
and-arrows, and his Skv-speaking lute, and fled. But the Sky-speaking
lute smote against a tree so that the earth resounded, and the great
Kami [Susanowo] started from sleep at the sound and pulled down
the palace.</p>
<p>While he was freeing his hair from the rafters, however, Great-
Land-Master fled a long way; so pursuing after him to the Level-
Pass-of-the-Land-of-Night, and gazing on him from afar, Brave-
Swift-Impetuous-Male called out to him, saying, “With the great,
life-preserving sword and the bow-and-arrow which you carry, pur¬
sue your low-born brethren till they crouch on the hill-slopes and are
swept into the river currents! And do you, fellow! make good your
name of Great-Land-Master, and your name of Spirit-of-the-Living-
Land, and making my daughter Princess-Forward your chief wife,
make strong the pillars of your palace at the foot of Mount Inquiry
in the lowest rock bottom, and rear its crossbeams to the Plain-of-the-
High-Sky, and dwell there!”</p>
<p>Then, bearing the great sword and book, Great-Land-Master pur¬
sued and scattered the eighty Kami, saying, “They shall not be
permitted within the circle of the blue fence of mountains.” He
pursued them till they crouched on every hill-slope, he pursued them
till they were swept into every river, and then he began to rule the
Land. (Therefore the place where he overtook them was called Come-
Overtake.) 4</p>
<p>Later on, the “Genesis” part of the Nihongi will be shown to
meet the requirements of archaic theory very exactly. Even inci¬
dents that seem like minor embellishments, the little mouse in her</p>

<p>burrow, arc really recurrent elements in the ancient fugue. Because
it is necessary to deal with one theme at a time, much of the talc
of Susauowo appears wildly arbitrary although no more so than
that of Samson. Also the narrative is confusingly interwoven with
other classic plots, recognizably those of Theseus and the Argo¬
nauts. And yet there Susanowo is, a maker of darkness at noon,
Samson strength-in-hair, who “went away with the pin of the
beam, and with the web,” walking off with rafters and rocks and
gates and posts, pulling down a palace (his own, for a change),
smiting and scattering iow-born workers of iniquity “not to be
permitted again within the circle of the blue fence.” But the
Nihovgi shows the ampler scheme in which the old order is
smashed and the new foundation of an order is undertaken: “make
strong the pillars of your palace at the foot of Mount Inquiry in
the lowest rock-bottom, and rear its crossbeams to the Plain-of-
thc -1 ligh Sky, and dwell there.”</p>
<p>The god has not only judged and apportioned, he has also estab¬
lished and sowed for the future in his capacity as the new king
of the Underworld; he has gone to sleep in his Ogygia, and ap¬
pointed his successor as ruler of the new age. Further, the Great-
Land-Master had to procure something in the Ncthcr-Distant-Land
(in Japan the dead go down there by land with countless wind¬
ings, whereas the whirlpool in the ocean is good only for trans¬
porting there the “sinful dirt”). He had been sent there to get
“counsel” from Susanowo (who identified him at the first glance
as: “This is the Kami Ugly-Malc-of-thc-Rccd-Plains”), he eventu¬
ally got it, and added to it the precious life-preserving sword which
Susanowo had found in the tail of the Eight-Forked Dragon, and
the “bow-and-arrows,” and his Orphic Sky-speaking lute, not to
forget Princess-Forward. A complicated affair. But the Great-
Land-Master undeniably plays a Jupiter role against Susanowo’s
Mars, the more so, as his beloved Princess-Forward turns out to be
extremely jealous.</p>
<p>Now, after this Far Eastern interlude, Samson’s own tragedy can
he seen in better focus (Judges xvi) :</p>

<li>And Delilah] made him sleep upon her knees; and she called
for a man. and she caused him to shave ofr the seven locks of his head;
and she began to afflict him. and his strength went from him.</li>
</ol>
<p>:o. And she said. The Philistines be upon thee. Samson. And he
awoke out of his sleep, and said. I will go out as at other times before,
and shake myself. And he wist not that the Lord was departed from
him.</p>
<p>:i. But the Philistines took him. and put out Inis eyes, and brought
him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did
grind in the prison house. [Appendix — 17]</p>
<dl>
<dt>Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was</dt>
<dt>shaven,</dt>
<dd>
<p>Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to re ; oice: for they
said. Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>
<p>And w hen the people saw him. they praised their god: for they
said. Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the
destroyer of our countin', which slew many of us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they
said. Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for
Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport; and they
set him between the pillars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand. Sutler
me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth. that I
may lean upon them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>2 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of
the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three
thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.</p>
<p>2$. And Samson called unto the Lord, and said. O Lord God. remem¬
ber me. pray thee, and strengthen me. I pray thee, only this once. O
God. that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two
eyes.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which
the house stood, and on which it was borne up. of the one with his
right hand, and of the other with his left.</li>
</ol>
<p>;o. And Samson said. Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
himself with all his might: and the house fell upon the lords, and
upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at
his death were more than they which he slew in his life.</p>
<p>Such is the great story, and it has gone through innumerable
variations.</p>
<p>The general design of the tragedy is obviously faulty, more even
than most Bible narratives which are superbly indifferent to such</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 174</p>
<p>considerations. If Samson had been bred as “a person separate to
God,” by the care of the Lord “who sought an occasion against the
Philistines,” he does not compare with chiefs like Joshua and
Gideon. He remains, mythically speaking, a misguided missile. Most
great feats of the mythistorical past would not have rated the atten¬
tion of news media, but Samson’s achievements make so little sense,
even on the micro-scale of Palestine power politics, that Milton
finds it hard to justify the ways of God to man. Certain “central”
events like the fall of royal houses, whether in Greece or Babylon
or Denmark, are capable of a truer and deeper reverberation. That
is why great motifs like “darkness at noon” and “pulling down the
edifice” combine into a larger theme, obviously cosmic, which is
here obscured. The Nihongi is truer to this larger style.</p>
<p>In the arabesque of interlaced motifs, one can mark those where
the theme of “pulling down the structure” is in evidence. The
powerful Maori hero Whakatau, bent on vengeance,</p>
<p>laid hold of the end of the rope which had passed round the posts of
the house, and, rushing out, pulled it with all his strength, and
straightaway the house fell down, crushing all within it, so that the
whole tribe perished, and Whakatau set it on fire. 5</p>
<p>This is familiar. At least one such event comes down dimly from
history. It happened to the earliest meetinghouse of the Pytha¬
gorean sect, and it is set down as a sober account of the outcome
of a political conflict, but the legend of Pythagoras was so artfully
constructed in early times out of prefabricated materials that doubt
is allowable. The essence of true myth is to masquerade behind
seemingly objective and everyday details borrowed from known
circumstances. However that may be, in many other stories the
destruction of the building is linked with a net. Saxo’s Amlethus
does not pull down pillars; he reappears at the banquet set by the
king for his own supposed funeral, like Great-Land-Master himself.
He throws the knotted carpet net prepared by his mother over the
drunken crowd and burns down the hall. In Japan the parallel does
not go farther than that but it has its own relevance nevertheless.
It suggests the fall of the House of Atreus. The net thrown by
5 See Sir George Grey, Polynesian Mythology (1956; 1st ed. 1855), pp. 97L</p>
<p>175 * Samson Under Many Skies</p>
<p>Clytemnestra over the king struggling in his bath cannot have come
in by chance. But this is an uncertain lead as yet.</p>
<p>The Sacred Book of the ancient Maya Quiche, the famous Popol
Vnh (the Book of Counsel) tells of Zipacna, son of Vucub-Caquix
(=Seven Arara). He sees 400 youths dragging a huge log that they
want as a ridgepole for their house. Zipacna alone carries the tree
without effort to the spot where a hole has been dug for the post
to support the ridgepole. The youths, jealous and afraid, try to kill
Zipacna by crushing him in the hole, but he escapes and brings
down the house on their heads. They are removed to the sky, in a
“group,” and the Pleiades are called after them (appendix #18).</p>
<p>Then there is a true avenger-of-his-father, the Tuamotuan Ta-
haki, who, after long travels, arrives in the dark at the house of
the goblin band who tortured his father. He conjures upon them
“the intense cold of Havaiki” (the other world) which puts them
to sleep.</p>
<p>Then Tahaki gathered up the net given to him by Kuhi, and carried
it to the door of the long house. He set fire to the house. When the
goblin myriads shouted out together “Where is the door?” Tahaki
called out: “Here it is.” They thought it was one of their own band
who had called out, and so they rushed headlong into the net, and
Tahaki burned them up in the fire. 6</p>
<p>What the net could be is known from the story of Kaulu. This
adventurous hero, wanting to destroy a she-cannibal, first flew up
to Makalii the great god, and asked for his nets, the Pleiades and the
Hyades, into which he entangled the evil one before he burned
down her house. 7 It is clear who was the owner of the nets up there.
The Pleiades are in the right hand of Orion on the Farnese Globe, 8
and they used to be called the “lagobolion” (hare net). The Hyades
were for big game. 9</p>
<p>At the end of this far-ranging exploration, it is fair now to ask,
who could Samson have been? Clearly a god, and a planetary</p>

<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 176</p>
<p>Power, for such were the gods of old. As Brave-Swift-Impetuous-
Male, as the Nazirite Strong One, he has all the countersigns that
belong to Mars, and to none other. Clearly, while trying to draw
the concluding episode of the investigation of Amlethus-Kronos,
King of the Cosmic Mill, something else has come into view, the
new and formidable personage of Mars—or Ares as the Greeks
called him. He will come back more than once. Yet there is no
question but that the name of Samson comes up quite spontane¬
ously in connection with the Sampo, the original quern. It was
clearly and unequivocally within the Amlethus design. At this
point, the intrusion of this new planetary Power must be recog¬
nized. Even Susanowo substitutes for Kronos in his very reign of
the Underworld. It would have been desirable to present the
Powers separately, and each in his own shape, as will be done
farther on. But the many-threaded tale has its own rules, and this
exemplifies an important one. There are no Powers more diverse
than Saturn and Mars; yet this is not the only time they will appear
as a confusing and unexplained doublet of the two.</p>
<p>One of the motifs, destruction, is often associated with the Am¬
lethus figure. The other belongs more specifically to Mars. There
is a peculiar blind aspect to Mars, insisted on in both Harranian
and Mexican myths. It is even echoed in Virgil: u caeco Marte .”
But it does not stand only for blind fury. It must be sought in the
Nether World, which will come soon. Meanwhile, here is the first
presentation of the double figure of Mars and Kronos. In Mexico,
it stands out dreadfully in the grotesque forms of the Black and the
Red Tezcatlipoca. There is a certain phase in the Great Tale, obvi¬
ously, in which the wrecking powers of Mars unleashed make up
a fatal compound with the avenging implacable design of Saturn.
Shakespeare has, with his preternatural insight, alluded to both
when he made Hamlet warn the raging Laertes before their final
encounter:</p>
<p>Though I am not by nature rash and splenetic</p>
<p>Yet there is in me something dangerous</p>
<p>Which let thy wisdom fear .. .</p>
<p>177 ’ Samson Under Many Skies</p>
<p>But obviously there is more, and what emerges here lifts the veil
of a fundamental archaic design. The real actors on the stage of
the universe are very few, if their adventures are many. The most
“ancient treasure”—in Aristotle’s word—that was left to us by our
predecessors of the High and Far-Off Times was the idea that the
gods are really stars, and that there are no others. The forces reside
in the starry heavens, and all the stories, characters and adventures
narrated by mythology concentrate on the active powers among
the stars, who are the planets. A prodigious assignment it may seem
for those few planets to account for all those stories and also to run
the affairs of the whole universe. What, abstractly, might be for
modern men the various motions of those pointers over the dial
became, in times without writing, where all was entrusted to images
and memory, the Great Game played over the aeons, a never-
ending tale of positions and relations, starting from an assigned
Time Zero, a complex web of encounters, drama, mating and
conflict.</p>
<p>Lucian of Samosata, that most delightful writer of antiquity, the
inventor of modern “science fiction,” who knew how to be light
and ironic on serious subjects without frivolity, and was fully aware
of the “ancient treasure,” remarked once that the ludicrous story
of Hephaistos the Lame surprising his wife Aphrodite in bed with
Mars, and pinning down the couple with a net to exhibit their
shame to the other gods, was not an idle fancy, but must have
referred to a conjunction of Mars and Venus, and it is fair to add,
a conjunction in the Pleiades.</p>
<p>This little comedy may serve to show the design, which turns out
to be constant: the constellations were seen as the setting, or the
dominating influences, or even only the garments at the appointed
time by the Powers in various disguises on their way through their
heavenly adventures.</p>
<p>No one could deny, in the case of the Amlethus-Samson epiph¬
any, that this fierce power, or momentary combination of powers,
wears here the figure of Orion the blind giant, called also Nimrod
the Hunter, brandishing the Hyades, working the Mill of the</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 178</p>
<p>Stars, like Talos, the bronze giant of Crete. For the feature which
