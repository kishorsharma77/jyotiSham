<p>.. quand les esprits bienheureux
Dans la Voie de Laict auront fait

<p>Agripp.1 SAubignt</p>
<p>Fire is. indeed, a key word, deserving a special inquiry. For the
time being, however, it is not essential to understand everything
about the different norms and measures, rules and regulations which
have to be procured by gods or heroes who are destined to open
“new ways.&quot; One can ignore here the true nature and identity of
the various &ldquo;treasures.&rdquo; whether they are called &ldquo;oar&rdquo; or “ferry
man.&quot; or &ldquo;hvama-melammu.” or &ldquo;golden fleece.&rdquo; or “fire.&rdquo; This is
not to say that all these terms are different names for the same
thing, but that they identify several parts of the frame. 1</p>
<p>It will be useful to recapitulate the ideas of the frame, as it has
been traced through the Greek precedents. It started out. inno¬
cently enough, with the frame of a ship (see above, pp. 13of.), as the
Greeks did. and finally ended up with the bewildering &ldquo;world tree&rdquo;
called the skmtbha , which even Plato might have found intractable.
In the end. it is nothing more than the structure of world colures,
even if it rustles with many centuries of Hindu verbiage.</p>
<p>1 Even a superficial study of the Chinese novel Feng Sben Yen I i.e„ Popular
Account of the Promotion to Divinin') which, under the disguise of &ldquo;historiogra¬
phy&rdquo; dealing with the end of the Shang Dynasty and the beginning of the Chou,
presents us with a fantastic description of a major crisis benveen world-ages, will
reveal to the attentive reader the amount of “new deities&quot;—responsible for old
cosmic functions—who have to be appointed at a new Zero, beginning with 365
gods, :8 new lunar mansions, etc.</p>
<p>I Iaailet’s Mill • 318</p>
<p>Another point to bear in mind is the cosmological relevance of
“way-openers” and “path-finders” like Gilgamesh. They are the
ones who bring the manifold measures from that mysterious center,
called Canopus or Eridu, or “the seat of Rita.” One can illustrate
the general scheme by means of two adventures.</p>
<p>The Argonauts, with the Golden Fleece on board, had to pass
the Symplegades, the clashing rocks. Once a ship with its crew
came through unharmed 2 —so the “blessed ones” ( makaroi) had
decided long ago—the Symplegades would stay fixed, and be clash¬
ing rocks no longer. 3 After that “accepting the novel laws of the
fixed earth,” they should “offer an easy passage to all ships, once
they had learnt defeat.” 4 This is only one station on the long “open¬
ing travel” of the Argonauts transporting the Golden Fleece (of a
ram), undertaken in all probability to introduce the Age of Aries, 5
but it demonstrates best the relevant point, namely, “the novel
laws.”</p>
<p>Another instance—in fact, a crucial one—of an Opening of the
Way comes to us from the Catlo’Itq in British Columbia. 6 We
would call it a pocket encyclopedia of myth:</p>
<p>A man had a daughter who possessed a wonderful bow and arrow,
with which she was able to bring down everything she wanted. But
she was lazy and was constantly sleeping. At this her father was angry
and said: “Do not be always sleeping, but take thy bow and shoot at
the navel of the ocean, so that we may get fire.”</p>
<p>2 The Symplegades cut off, however, the ornament of the ship’s stern (aphla-
stoio akra korymba), where the “soul” of the ship was understood to dwell. We
do not know yet the precise meaning of this trait. Cf. H. Diels, “Das Aphlaston
der antiken Schiffe,” in Z eitschrift des Vereins fiir Volkskunde (1915), pp. 61-80.
It should be emphasized that, contrary to a widespread opinion, the planktai and
the symplegades are not identical.</p>
<p>3 Apollonios Rhodios, Argonautica 2.592-606; Pindar, Pyth. 4.210: “but that
voyage of the demigods made them stand still in death.”</p>
<p>4 Claudianus 26.8-11.</p>
<p>5 See the First Vatican Mythographer (c. 24, ed. Bode, vol. /, p. 9) stating
about “Pelias vel Peleus” that he sent Jason to Colchis, “ut inde detulisset pellem
auream, in qua Juppiter in caelum ascendit,” i.e., to fetch the Golden Fleece, in
which Jupiter climbs the sky. See also A. B. Cook, “The European Sky-God,”

<p>319 • Gilgamesh and Prometheus</p>
<p>The navel of the ocean was a vast whirlpool in which sticks for mak¬
ing fire by friction were drifting about. At that time men were still
without fire. Now the maiden seized her bow, shot into the navel of
the ocean, and the material for fire-rubbing sprang ashore.</p>
<p>Then the old man was glad. He kindled a large fire; and as he wanted
to keep it to himself, he built a house with a door which snapped up
and down like jaws and killed everybody that wanted to get in. But
the people knew that he was in possession of the fire, and the stag
determined to steal it for them. He took resinous wood, split it and
stuck the splinters in his hair. Then he lashed two boats together,
covered them with planks, danced and sang on them, and so he came
to the old man’s house. He sang: “O, I go and will fetch the fire.”
The old man’s daughter heard him singing, and said to her father:
“O, let the stranger come into the house; he sings and dances so
beautifully.”</p>
<p>The stag landed and drew near the door, singing and dancing, and at
the same time sprang to the door and made as if he wanted to enter
the house. Then the door snapped to, without however touching him.
But while it was again opening, he sprang quickly into the house.
Here he seated himself at the fire, as if he wanted to dry himself, and
continued singing. At the same time he let his head bend forward
over the fire, so that he became quite sooty, and at last the splinters
in his hair took fire. Then he sprang out, ran off and brought the fire
to the people.</p>
<p>Such is the story of Prometheus in Catlo’ltq. It is more than that.
For the stag has stood for a long time for Kronos. In the Hindu
tradition he is Yama who has been met before as Yama Agastya,
and who, “following the course of the great rivers, discovered the
way for many.” This stag is spread far and wide in the archaic
world, with the same connotations. And he is the archaic Prome-
theus-Kronos, “you who consume all and increase it again by the
unlimited order of the Aion, wily-minded, you of crooked counsel,
venerable Prometheus.” In Greek, semne Prometheu . It leaves no
doubts. The Orphic invocation to Kronos, quoted in the very be¬
ginning on p. 12, defines him as “venerable” and couples him with
the name of Kronos the Titan, and we did not go on to quote
the awful name of Prometheus so as not to confuse the issue. To
avoid confusing matters gratuitously, the name Prometheus has
so far been used sparingly. It summons up a formidable implex. The</p>
<p>I Iamlet’s Mill • 320</p>
<p>scholiast of Sophocles who gave the reference, quoting Polemon
and Lysimachidcs who arc now lost sources, explains: “Prometheus
was the first and the older who held in his right hand the scepter,
but Hephaistos later and second.” 7</p>
<p>These are the underground regions of Greek mythology, still
barely noticed by the school of Frazer and Harrison in their search
for prehistoric cults and symbols in the classical world. Yet here
ancient Greek myth suddenly emerges in full light among Indian
tribes in America, miraculously preserved. The very unnaturalness
of the narrative shows how steps were telescoped or omitted
through the ages. In one moment the Whirlpool emerges as the
bearer of the fire-sticks of Pramantha and Tezcatlipoca. But why
should they be in the whirl? Myth has its own shorthand logic to
relate those floating fire-sticks to the cosmic whirl. And that logic
goes on tying together the basic themes, the bow and the arrow of
celestial kingship, the bow and arrow aimed at (or ending in)
Sirius, Stella marls (compare appendix #2 on Orendel).</p>
<p>The singing and dancing of the stag is intricately involved with a
proto-Pythagorean theme. And the theme appears full-fledged in
still another tale from the Northwest. The Son of Woodpecker,
before shooting his bow, intoned a song, and as soon as he had
found the right note, the flying arrows stuck in each other’s necks
until they built the bridge of arrows to heaven; Sir James Frazer
himself identified this theme with that of the scaling of Olympus in
the Gigantomachy. But there is more. Although it is not stated
explicitly that the “clashing doors” (the precessing equinoxes) of
the old owner of fire ceased to clash, surely the stag opened a new
passage by passing the door at the predestined right moment in his
quest for the “fire.”</p>
<p>There was little room for invention and variation in this solemn
play with the great themes, although imagination did retain some
freedom. Thus one might feel tempted to see pure imagination in
the feckless laziness of the Old Adan’s Daughter. And yet, was it
imagination, if one discovers in her the prototype of Ishtar, of
whom it was said (see above, p. 215) that she “stirs up the apsu
before Ea”? Lady-archers being a rare species, it is worth considera-
7 Schol. Soph. O. C. 56 (Mayer, Giganten und Titanen , p. 95).</p>
<p>321 • Gilgamesh and Prometheus</p>
<p>tion that the great Babylonian astronomical text, the so-called
“Series mul APIN” (= Series Plough-Star, the Plough-Star being
Triangulum), states: “the Bow-star is the Ishtar of Elam, daughter
of Enlil.” There has been mention of the constellation of the Bow,
built by stars of Argo and Canis Major, Sirius serving as “Arrow-
Star” (see above, p. 216 and figure on p. 290). It is no less signifi¬
cant that the Egyptian divine archeress, Satit, aims her arrow at
Sirius, as can be seen on the round Zodiac of Dendera.</p>
<p>When one discovers a brief tale that miraculously encapsulates
great myths in a few words, one is led to the suspicion that such
tales are fragments of long and intricate recitals meant to hold their
audience for hours; that, actually they represent something like
“Apollodorus” or “Hyginus” who passed on the essential informa¬
tion in brief abstracts. But behind them stood a fully shaped and
powerful literary tradition along with the Greek poets to give the
ideas flesh and blood, whereas with an illiterate neolithic people
such as the Catlo’ltq only the bare skeleton, even “Hygini Fabulae,”
appears to have survived, unless we assume the informants withheld
from the ethnologists the richer versions. (A colleague once told
us about a Tibetan minstrel who, bidden to recite the saga of Bogda
Gesser Khan, asked whether he should do the large version or the
small one: the large would have taken weeks to recite properly.)</p>
<p>It was stated earlier and should be re-stated here that “/zre” &lsquo;was
thought of as a great circle reaching from one celestial pole to the
other , and also that the fire sticks belong to the skambha (Atharva
Veda 1 0.8.20), as an essential part of the frame. Among the things
which helped us to recognize “/zre” as the equinoctial colure , only
one fact needs mention here, that the Aztecs took Castor and Pollux
(alpha beta Geminorum) for the first fire sticks, from which man¬
kind learned how to drill fire. This is known from Sahagun. 8 Con¬
sidering that the equinoctial colure of the Golden Age ran through
Gemini (and Sagittarius), the fire sticks in Gemini offer a correct</p>
<p>8 Florentine Codex (trans. Anderson and Dibble), vol. 7, p. 60. See also R.
Simeon, Dictionnaire de la Langne Nalmatl (1885) s.v. “mamalhuaztli: Les Ge-
meaux, constellation,” who does not mention, though, that Sahagun identified
mamalhuaztli with “astijellos,” fire sticks. Also, the Tasmanians felt indebted to
Castor and Pollux for the first fire (see J. G. Frazer, Myths of the Origin of
Fire [1930], pp. 3F).</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 322</p>
<p>rhyme to a verse in a Mongolian nuptial prayer which says: “Fire
was born, when Heaven and Earth separated”; 9 in other words,
before the falling apart of ecliptic and equator, there was no “fire,”
the first being kindled in the Golden Age of the Twins.</p>
<p>There is no certainty yet whether or not there are fixed rules,
according to which one fire has to be fetched from the North, and
the other from the South; both methods are employed. The Finns,
for example, insist on the fire’s “cradle on the navel of the sky,”
whence it rushes through seven or nine skies into the sea, to the
bottom if it, in fact. 10 And Tezcatlipoca is claimed to be sitting at
the celestial North Pole also, when drilling fire in the year 2-Reed,
after the flood. Whereas it is said of the so-called fire-god of
Mesopotamia:</p>
<p>Gibil, the exalted hero whom Ea adorned with terrible brilliance
f = melammu], who grew up in the pure apsu, who in Eridu, the place
of (determining) fates, is unfailingly prepared, whose pure light
reaches heaven—his bright tongue flashes like lightning; Gibil’s light
flares up like the day. 11</p>
<p>Gibil is also called, briefly, “hero, child of the Apsu.” If the “fire,”
adorned with “terrible brilliance”—melammu/hvarna—is prepared
in Eridu, one should be permitted to conclude that it has to be pro¬
cured from there, just as the Rigvedic Agni-Matarishvan, one
among the Agnis, “fires,” had to be sought at the “confluence of
the rivers” (appendix #38).</p>
<p>But whether the “fire” comes from “above” or from “below,”
the divine or semidivine (or two-thirds divine as Gilgamesh) beings
who bring it from either topos could all be named after their com¬
mon function, as is done in Mexico, where Quetzalcouatl is also
called “Ce acatl” = 1-Reed, 12 and Tezcatlipoca “Omacatl (Ome</p>

K. Tallqvist, Akkadische Gotterepitheta (1939), p. 313.</p>
<p>12 Acatl/Reed represents, indeed, the arrow-stick, the drill stick of the fire drill
and the “symbol of juridical power.” See E. Seler, Gesavnnelte Abhandlungen
(1960-61), vol. 2, pp. 996, 1102; vol. 4, p. 224.</p>
<p>323 * Gilgamesh and Trometheus</p>
<p>acatl) = 2-Reed. In the same way we might call the corresponding
heroes of the Old World “i-Narthex,” “2-Narthex,” and so forth,
after the “reed,” in which the stolen fire was brought by the most
famous Titan, Prometheus, a “portion” of Saturn.</p>
<p>Without taking part in the heated discussion on the interpretation
of the very name Gilgamesh— d GIS.GIN.MEZ/MAS, and other
forms—one can mention that GIS means “wood, tree,” and MEZ/
MAS a particular kind of wood, 13 and that there are reasons for
understanding our hero as a true Prometheus.</p>
<p>Here it is worth turning briefly to a text recently translated anew
and edited by P. Gossmann, the tablets of the Era-Epos. This is a
grim poem, whose appalling fierceness emerges in almost every
word, dedicated as it is to the god of Death, Era (also spelled Irra),
a part of Nergal. The subject matter is wholly mythological, han¬
dling the end of a world in terms which would hardly disgrace the
Edda, and dealing again with the Flood to end all floods in the
gloomy spirit of Genesis. But here something shines out unmistak¬
ably that the commentators on Genesis have missed. They have
missed it so completely that even in our day some well-intentioned
Fundamentalists applied for permission to search for the remains of
the Ark on Mount Ararat. They were impatiently denied access
by the Soviet authorities, who suspected espionage with a CIA
cover name. No one, they figured, could be that simpleminded. The
simplemindedness obviously extends to the researchers of the Su-
merological Institutes, who went looking for Eridu in the Persian
Gulf, and for the dwelling of the divine barmaid Siduri on the
shores of the Mediterranean. But it is evident that the events of the
Flood in the Era Epic, however vivid their language, apply unmis¬
takably to events in the austral heavens and to nothing else.</p>
<p>It becomes evident that all the adventures of Gilgamesh, even
if ever so earthily described, have no conceivable counterpart on
earth. They are astronomically conceived from A to Z—even as the</p>
<p>13 See R. Labat, Manuel d’Epigraphie Akkadienne (4th ed., 1963), nos. 29 6, 314;
also F. Delitzch, Assyrischisches Handworterbuch (1896), p. 420 s.v. miskannu;
Tallqvist, s.v. Gilgamesh. Albright calls Gilgamesh “torch-fecundating hero
(JAOS 40, p. 318).</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 324</p>
<p>fury of Era docs not apply to some meteorological “Lord Storm”
but to events which arc imagined to take place among constella¬
tions. The authors of Sumer and Babylon describe their hair-raising
catastrophes of the Flood without a thought of earthly events.
Their imagination and calculations as well as their thought belong
wholly among the stars. Their capacity for transposition seems to
have been utterly lost to us earthlings, of the earth earthy, who
think only of “primitive” images and primitive experiences, which
could account for the narrative so intensely and humanly projected.
Perhaps they are mutants from our type. In any case they seem be¬
yond the comprehension of mature contemporary intellects, who
have adjusted comfortably to the mental standards of Desmond
Morris’ Naked Ape of their own devising.</p>
<p>These phantoms being now laid to rest, one finds oneself dealing
with utterly unknown ancestors, whose biblical rages and passions
have to be read in an entirely new context. To be sure, the planets
are still neighbors: Mars, who is Era and Nergal, is only a few
light-minutes away, Marduk-Jupiter about eight minutes, Saturn an
hour. But they are all equally lost in cosmic space, their optical
evidence, like that of ghosts, equally unseizable, equally potent or
impotent in terms of present physical standards, equally and dread¬
fully present according to those other standards.</p>
<p>Era is sternly reprimanded by Jupiter/Marduk for having sent
his weapons forth to destroy what remained after the Flood (Ea
once spoke in the same vein to Enlil after the earlier Flood) but
Marduk saved seven wise ones ( ummani) by causing them to de¬
scend to the Apsu or Abyss, and to the precious 7 /zes-trees by chang¬
ing their places. “Because of this work, O hero, which thou didst
command to be done, where is the 7 ;/e.y-tree, flesh of the gods,
adornment of kings?” “The mesu-tTtt,&quot; says Marduk, “had its
roots in the wide sea, in the depth of Arallu, and its top attained
to high heaven.” He asks Era where are the lapis lazuli, the gods
of the arts, and the seven wise ones of the Apsu. He might well
ask where is Gilgamesh himself, that deceptively human hero, now
transformed into a beacon of light from a mes-tTtz of other-worldly
dimensions. Such is the fate of heroes, as they have been followed</p>
<p>325 • Gilgamesh and Prometheus</p>
<p>from Amlodhi onwards, whether they come as a spark hiding in a
narthex like Prometheus, or fire from the wood splinters in Stag’s
hairs, or become a beam from Canopus-Eridu. Lost in the depths of
the Southern Ocean, they were capable of giving the Depths of the
Sea to our forefathers, and now are able to have the directional
systems of our missiles lock on them for interplanetary flight—they
remain points, circles, geometries of light to guide mankind past
and future on its way.</p>
<p>And so under the present circumstances it is necessary to leave
Era’s somber prophecy unfulfilled, relating as it does to a coming
world age:</p>
<p>Open the way, I &lsquo;will take the road ,</p>
<p>The days are ended, the fixed time has past.</p>
<p>But with it comes the clearest statement ever uttered by men or
gods concerning the Precession. Says Marduk:</p>
<p>When I stood up from my seat and let the flood break in ,
then the judgement of Earth and Heaven went out of joint. ..</p>
<p>The gods , which trembled , the stars of heaven —
their position changed , and 1 did not bring them back.</p>
