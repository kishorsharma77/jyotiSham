<p>Apollinaire,</p>
<p>La Chanson du Mal-Aime</p>
<p>M E .s spirits were thought to dwell in the Milky Way be¬
tween incarnations. This conception has been handed down as an
Orphic and Pythagorean tradition 1 fitting into the frame of the
migration of the soul. Macrobius, who has provided the broadest
report on the matter, has it that souls ascend by way of Capricorn,
and then, in order to be reborn, descend again through the “Gate
of Cancer.” 2 Macrobius talks of signs; the constellations rising at
the solstices in his time (and still in ours) were Gemini and Sagit¬
tarius: the “Gate of Cancer” means Gemini. In fact, he states ex¬
plicitly (/.12.5) that this “Gate” is “where the Zodiac and the
Milky Way intersect.” Far away, the Mangaians of old (Austral
Islands, Polynesia), who kept the precessional clock running in¬
stead of switching over to “signs,” claim that only at the evening
of the solstitial days can spirits enter heaven, the inhabitants of the</p>

<p>northern parts of the island at one solstice, the dwellers in the
south at the other. 3 This information, giving precisely fixed dates,
is more valuable than general statements to the effect that the Poly¬
nesians regarded the Milky Way as “the road of souls as they pass
to the spirit world.” 4 In Polynesian myth, too, souls are not per¬
mitted to stay unless they have reached a stage of unstained perfec¬
tion, which is not likely to occur frequently. Polynesian souls have
to return into bodies again, sooner or later. 5</p>
<p>Two instances of relevant American Indian notions are worth
mentioning without discussion. The important thing is that the
tradition is there, more or less intact. Among the Sumo in Hon¬
duras- and Nicaragua their “Mother Scorpion &hellip; is regarded as
dwelling at the end of the Milky Way, where she receives the souls
of the dead, and from her, represented as a mother with many
breasts, at which children take suck, come the souls of the new¬
born.” 6 Whereas the Pawnee and Cherokee say: 7 “The souls of
the dead are received by a star at the northern end of the Milky

and difficult arm, women and those who die of old age upon the
brighter and easier path. The souls then journey southwards. At the
end of the celestial pathway they are received by the Spirit Star,
and there they make their home.” One can quietly add “for a
while,” or change it to “there they make their camping place.”
Hagar takes the “Spirit Star” to be Antares (alpha Scorpii).
Whether or not it is precisely alpha, because the star marks the
southern “end” of the Galaxy, the southern crossroads with the</p>

<p>5 Since so many earlier and recent “reporters at large” fail to inform us of tradi¬
tions concerning reincarnation, we may mention that according to the Marquesans
“all the souls of the dead, after having lived in one or the other place (i.e., Paradise
or Hades) for a very long time, returned to animate other bodies” (R. W. Wil¬
liamson, Religious and Cosmic Beliefs of Central Polynesia [1924], vol. /, p. 208),
which recalls the wording of the case as we know it from book X of Plato’s
Republic.</p>

<p>ecliptic, it is at any rate a star of Sagittarius, or Scorpius. 8 That fits
“Mother Scorpion’’ of Nicaragua and the “Old goddess with the
scorpion tail” of the Maya as it also fits the Scorpion-goddess Sel-
kct-Serqet of ancient Egypt and the Ishara tam.tim of the Baby¬
lonians. Ishara of the sea, goddess of the constellation Scorpius, was
also called “Lady of the Rivers” (compare appendix #30).</p>
<p>Considering the fact that the crossroads of ecliptic and Galaxy-
are crisis-resistant, that is, not concerned with the Precession, the
reader may want to know why the Mangaians thought they could
go to heaven only on the two solstitial days. Because, in order to
“change trains” comfortably, the constellations that serve as “gates”
to the Milky Way must “stand” upon the “earth,” meaning that
they must rise heliacally either at the equinoxes or at the solstices.
The Galaxy is a very- broad highway, but even so there must have
been some bitter millennia when neither gate was directly available
any longer, the one hanging in midair, the other having turned into
a submarine entrance.</p>
<p>Sagittarius and Gemini still mark the solstices in the closing years
of the Age of Pisces. Next comes Aquarius. The ancients, no doubt,
would have considered the troubles of these our times, the over¬
population, the “working iniquity- in secret,” as an inevitable pre¬
lude to a new tilting, a new world-age.</p>
<p>But the coming of Pisces was long looked forward to, heralded
as a blessed age. It was introduced by- the thrice-repeated Great
Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Pisces in the y-ear 6 B.c., the
star of Bethlehem. Virgil announced the return of the Golden Age
under the rule of Saturn, in his famous Fourth Eclogue: “Now the
Virgin returns, the reign of Saturn returns, now a new generation
descends from heaven on high. Only do thou, pure Lucina, smile on
the birth of the child, under whom the iron brood shall first cease,
and a golden race spring up throughout the world!” Although pro-</p>
<p>8 This is no slip of the tongue; the zodiacal Sagittarius of Mesopotamian bound¬
ary stones had, indeed, the tail of a Scorpion: but we just must not be drowned in
the abyss of details of comparative constellation lore, and least of all in those con¬
nected with Sagittarius, two-faced as he is, half royal, half dog.</p>
<p>245 ' The Galaxy</p>
<p>moted to the rank of a “Christian honoris causa” on account of this
poem, Virgil was no “prophet,” nor was he the only one who ex¬
pected the return of Kronos-Satum. 9 “lam redit et Virgo, redeunt
Saturnia regna.” What does it mean? Where has Virgo been, sup¬
posedly, so that one expected the constellation “back”?</p>
<p>Aratus, in his renowned astronomical poem (95-136), told how
Themis-Virgo, who had lived among humans peacefully, retired at
the end of the Golden Age to the “hills,” no longer mingling with
the silver crowd that had started to populate the earth, and that she
took up her heavenly abode near Bootes, when the Bronze Age
began. 10 And there is Virgil announcing Virgo’s return. This makes
it easy to guess time and “place” of the Golden Age. One need only
turn back the clock for one quarter “hour” of the Precession (about
6,000 years from Virgil), to find Virgo standing firmly at the sum¬
mer solstitial corner of the abstract plane “earth.” “Returning,” that
is moving on, Virgo would indicate the autumnal equinox at the
time when Pisces took over the celestial government of the vernal
equinox, at the new crossroads.</p>
<p>Once the Precession had been discovered, the Milky Way took
on a new and decisive significance. For it was not only the most
spectacular band of heaven, it was also a reference point from
which the Precession could be imagined to have taken its start. This
would have been when the vernal equinoctial sun left its position
in Gemini in the Milky Way. When it was realized the sun had
been there once, the idea occurred that the Milky Way might mark
the abandoned track of the sun—a burnt-out area, as it were, a
scar in heaven. Decisive notions have to be styled more carefully,
however: so let us say that the Milky Way was a reference “point”
from which the Precession could be termed to have taken its start,
and that the idea which occurred was not that the Milky Way</p>

of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes u (1948), pp. 54^, and “Der Heilige und

<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 246</p>
<p>might mark the abandoned track of the sun, but that the Milky
Way was an image of an abandoned track, a formula that offered
rich possibilities for “telling” complicated celestial changes.</p>
<p>With this image and some additional galactic lore, it is now
possible to concentrate on the formula by which the Milky Way
became the way of the spirits of the dead, a road abandoned by the
living. The abandoned path is probably the original form of the
notions insistently built around a projected Time Zero. If the Pre¬
cession was seen as the great clock of the Universe, the sun, as it
shifted at the equinox, remained the measure of all measures, the
“golden cord,” as Socrates says in Plato’s Theaetetus (153c). In
fact, apart from the harmonic intervals, the sun was the only ab¬
solute measure provided by nature. The sun must be understood to
be conducting the planetary fugues at any given moment as Plato
also showed in the Timaeus. Thus, when the sun at his counting
station moved on toward the Milky Way, the planets, too, were
termed to hunt and run this way.</p>
<p>This does not make very sound geometrical sense, but it shows
how an image can dominate men’s minds and take on a life of its
own. Yet the technical character of these images should not be
forgotten, and it is to prevent this that the verbs “to term” and “to
spell out” are used so often instead of the customary expression “to
believe.”</p>
<p>To the American Plains Indians, the Milky Way was the dusty
track along which the Buffalo and the Horse once ran a race across
the sky. 11 For the Fiote of the African Loango Coast the race was
run by Sun and Moon. 12 The East African Turu took it for the
“cattle track” of the brother of the creator, 13 which is very close to
the Greek legend of Herakles moving the herd of Geryon. 14 The
convergence of so many animal tracks along this heavenly way is,
once again, not a pointless conjunction of fancies. The Arawak of
Guyana call the Galaxy “the Tapir’s way.” This is confirmed in a</p>

<p>tale of the Chiriguano and some groups of the Tupi-Guarani of
South America. According to Lehman-Nitsche, these people speak
of the Galaxy as “the way of the true father of the Tapir,” a Tapir-
deity which is itself invisible. 15 Now, if this hidden deity turns out
to be Quetzalcouatl himself, ruler of the Golden Age town Tollan,
no other than “Tixli cumatz,” the tapir-serpent dwelling in the
“middle of the sea’s belly,” as the Maya tribes of Yucatan describe
him, 16 the allusions begin to focus. Finally, the actual scheme is
found in that Cuna tradition described earlier: the Tapir chopped
down the “Saltwater Tree,” at the roots of which is God’s whirl¬
pool, and when the tree fell, saltwater gushed out to form the
oceans of the world.</p>
<p>Should the Tapir still seem to lack the appropriate dignity, some
Asiatic testimonies should be added. The Persian Bundahishn calls
the Galaxy the “Path of Kay-us,” after the grandfather and co¬
regent of Kai Khusrau, the Iranian Hamlet. 17 Among the Altaic
populations the Yakuts call the Milky Way the “tracks of God,”
and they say that, while creating the world, God wandered over the
sky; more general in use seems to have been the term “Ski-tracks of
God’s son,” whereas the Voguls spelled it out “Ski-tracks of the
forest-man.” And here the human tracks fade out, although the
snowshoes remain. For the Tungus the Galaxy is “Snowshoe-tracks
of the Bear.” But whether the figure is the son of God, the forest-
man, or the Bear, he hunted a stag along the Milky Way, tore it up
and scattered its limbs in the sky right and left of the white path, and
so Orion and Ursa Major were separated. 18 The “Foot of the Stag”
reminded Holmberg immediately of the “Bull’s Thigh” of ancient
Egypt—Ursa Major. With his penetrating insight he might easily
have gone on to recognize, in that potent thigh, the isolated “one-
leg” of Texcatlipoca, Ursa Major again, in Mexico—the day-sign</p>

<p>“Crocodile” (Cipactli) had bitten it off—the great Hunrakan
(= 1 leg) of the Maya Quiche. 19</p>
<p>There is an insistent association here, right below the surface,
which is still revealed by the old Dutch name for the Galaxy,
“Brunelstraat.” Brunei, Bruns, Bruin (the Brown) is the familiar
name of the bear in the romance of Reynard the Fox, and is as
ancient as anything that can be traced. 20 It is a strange lot of charac¬
ters that were made responsible for the Milky Way: gods and
animals leaving the path that had been used at “creation” time. 21 But
where did they go, the ones mentioned, and the many whom we
have left out of consideration? It depends, so to speak, from where
they took off. This is often hard to determine, but the subject of
“tumbling down” will be dealt with next.</p>
<p>As for Virgo, who had left the “earth” at the end of the Golden
Age, her whereabouts in the Silver Age could have been described</p>
<p>19 Going farther south, he would have found there again the lining up of Ursa
and Orion and the violent tearing up of celestial figures. Says W. E. Roth (“An
Inquiry into the Animism and Folk-lore of the Guiana Indians,” 30th ARBAE
1908-09 [1915], p. 262; cf. Zerries, pp. 220L) of the Indians of Guiana: “All the
legends relating to the constellations Taurus and Orion have something in common
in the detail of an amputated arm or leg.” And that goes for parts of Indonesia too.
But then, Ursa Major is the thigh of a Bull, and the zodiacal Taurus is so badly
amputated, there is barely a half of him left. More peculiar still, in later Egyptian
times it occurs, if rarely, that Ursa is made a ram’s thigh (see G. A. Wainwright,
“A Pair of Constellations,” in Studies Presented to F. L. Griffith [1932], p. 373);
and on the round zodiac of Dendera (Roman period) we find a ram sitting on that
celestial leg, representing Ursa, and it even looks back, as befits the traditional
zodiacal Aries. We must leave it at that.</p>
<p>20 The notion of the Milky Way as “Brunelstraat” seems to be present in ancient
India: the Atharva Veda 18. 2.31 mentions a certain path or road called rikshaka.
Riksha is the bear in both senses, i.e., the animal and Ursa Major (see H. Grass-
mann, Worterbuch zum Rig-Veda [1915] s.v. Riksha). Whitney (in his translation
of AV, p. 840) suggested rikshaka as a road “infested by bears (?).” A. Weber,
however, proposed to identify rikshaka with the Milky Way (“Miszellen aus dem
indogermanischen Familienleben,” in Festgruss Roth [1893], P* U8). Since the
whole hymn AV 18. 2 contains “Funeral Verses,” and deals with the voyage of the
soul, that context too would be fitting. (That the souls have to first cross a river
“rich with horses” is another matter.)</p>
<p>21 The shortest abbreviation: the Inca called Gemini “creation time” (Hagar, in
14th International Amerikanisten-Kongress [1904], p. 599L). But the very same
notion is alluded to, when Castor and Pollux (alpha beta Geminorum) are made
responsible for the first fire sticks, by the Aztecs (Sahagun) and, strange to say,
by the Tasmanians. (See below, chapter XXIII, “Gilgamesh and Prometheus.”)</p>
<p>249 * The Galaxy</p>
<p>as being “in mid-air.” Many iniquitous characters were banished to
this topos; either they were thrown down, or they were sent up
—Lilith dwelt there for a while, and King David , 22 also Adonis , 23
even the Tower of Babel itself, and first of all the Wild Hunter
(appendix #20). This assembly of figures “in mid-air” helps to
give meaning to an otherwise pointless tale, a veritable fossil
found in Westphalian folklore: “The Giants called to Hackelberg
[= Odin as the Wild Hunter] for help. He raised a storm and
removed a mill into the Milky Way, which after this is called the
Mill Way .” 24 There are other fossils, too, the wildest perhaps being
that of the Cherokee who called the Galaxy “Where the dog ran.”
A very unusual dog it must have been, being in the habit of stealing
meal from a corn mill owned by “people in the South” and running
with it to the North; the dog dropped meal as he ran and that is
the Milky Way . 25 It is difficult here to recognize Isis scattering ears
of wheat in her flight from Typhon . 26 And yet, the preference of
the very many mythical dogs, foxes, coyotes—and even of the
“way-opening” Fenek in West Sudan—for meal and all sorts of
grain—more correctly “the eight kinds of grain”—a trait which is
hardly learned by eavesdropping on Mother Nature, could have
warned the experts to beware of these doggish characters. They are
not to be taken at their pseudo-zoological face value.</p>
<p>Thus, everybody and everything has left the course, Wild
Hunter, dog and mill—at least its upper half, since through the
hole in the lower millstone the whirlpool is seething up and down.</p>
