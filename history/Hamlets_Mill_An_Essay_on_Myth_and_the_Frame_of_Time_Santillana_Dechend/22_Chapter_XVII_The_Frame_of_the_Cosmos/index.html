  <p>La mythologie, dans son origine,
est l’ouvrage de la science; la
science seule l’expliquera.</p>
<p>Charles Dupuis</p>
<p>Jn Greek myth, the basic frame of the world is described in the
famous Vision of Er in the ioth Book of the Republic. In it we find
Er the Armenian, who was resurrected from the funeral pyre just
before it was kindled, and who describes his travel through the
other world (/ 0.6 15ff.). He and the group of souls bound for re¬
birth whom he accompanies travel through the other world. They
come to “a straight shaft of light, like a pillar, stretching from above
throughout heaven and earth—and there, at the middle of the light,
they saw stretching from heaven the extremities of its chains; for
this light binds the heavens, holding together all the revolving
firmament like the undergirths of a ship of war. And from the
extremities stretched the Spindle of Necessity, by means of which
all the circles revolve.”</p>
<p>Cornford adds in a note: “It is disputed whether the bond hold¬
ing the Universe together is simply the straight axial shaft or a
circular band of light, suggested by the Milky Way, 1 girdling the
heaven of fixed stars.” 2 Eisler understood it as the zodiac, strange
to say. 3 Since those “undergirths” of the trireme did not go around
the ship horizontally, but were meant to secure the mast (the</p>
<p>1 Cf. O. Gruppe, Griechische Mythologie imd Religionsgeschichte (1906), p.
1036, n. 1: “probably the Milky Way.”</p>

<p>“tree” of the ship) which points upwards, we stand, on princi¬
ple, for the Galaxy, which, however, had to be “replaced” by in¬
visible colures in later times. 4 But Er also talks of the adventures of
the souls between incarnations, and in this context we might rely
on the Milky Way. Surely the “model” is far from clear, even, on
Cornford’s concession, obviously intentionally so. And indeed, a
few paragraphs later, there comes the complete planetarium with
its “whorls,” the “Spindle of Necessity” held by the goddess, by
which sit the Fates as they unwind the threads of men’s lives. The
souls can listen to the Song of Lachesis, if they are still in the
“meadow,” but the chains and shaft or band are no longer in
the picture. Plato refuses to be a correct geometrician of the Other
World, just as he would not be sensible about the hydraulics of
it. But previously in the Phaedo, Socrates had been ironic about
the “truths” of science, and insisted that the truths of myth are of
another order, and rebellious to ordinary consistency. It is here as if
Plato had juxtaposed a number of revered mythical traditions (in¬
cluding the planetary harmony) without pretending to fit them into
a proper order. And so his image of the “framework” of the cosmos
is left inconclusive. But somehow the axis and the band and the
chains stand together, and this, one concludes, was the original idea.
The rotation of the polar axis must not be disjointed from the
great circles which shift along with it in heaven. The framework
is thought of as all one with the axis. This leads back to a Pythago¬
rean authority whom Plato was supposed to have followed (Timon
even viciously said: plagiarized) and whom Socrates often quotes
with unfeigned respect. It is Philolaos, surely a creative astronomer
of high rank, from whom there are only a few surviving fragments,
and the authenticity of these has been rashly challenged by many
modern philologists. 5 In fragment 12 of Philolaos, there is a brief
definition of the cosmos, very much in the spirit of Plato’s dode-</p>
<p>4 Cf. also the discussion in J. L. E. Dreyer, A History of Astronomy from
Thales to Kepler (1953), pp. 56#. Concerning the “chains,” which he translates
“ligatures,” Dreyer states: “The ligatures ( desmoi ) of the heavens are the solstitial
and equinoctial colures intersecting in the poles, which points therefore may be
called their extremities ( akra ).”</p>

<p>cahedron quoted in chapter XII. “In the sphere there are five ele¬
ments, those inside the sphere, fire, and water and earth and air,
and what is the hull of the sphere, the fifth.” 6 Notwithstanding
Philolaos’ graceless Doric, the statement is perfectly clear. The
“hull,” (olkas) was the common name for freighters, built for bulk
cargo, broad in the beam. It is really more adequate than Plato’s
slim trireme; and it is closer in shape to what both men meant
apparently: the dodecahedron, the “hull,” i.e., the sphere, the
actual containing frame. It is clear from Plato that the “fifth” is the
sphere that he calls ether which contains the four earthly elements
but is wholly removed from them. Aristotle was to change it to the
crystalline heavenly “matter” that he needed for his system, but
it remained for him a “fifth essence.” There has thus been twice
repeated the original “hull,” the frame that has been sought. What
happened, and was noted in chapter VII, was that the etymology
of Sampo was discovered to be in the Sanskrit skambha.</p>
<p>The abstract idea of a simple earth axis, so natural today, was
by no means so logical to the ancients, who always thought of the
whole machinery of heaven moving around the earth, stable at the
center. One line always implied many others in a structure. So,
apparently one must accept the idea of the world frame as an implex
(as used here and later this word involves the necessary attributes
that are associated with a concept: e.g., the center and circumfer¬
ence of a circle, the parallels and meridians implied by a sphere),
of which Grotte and Sampo were the rude models with their pon¬
derous moving parts.</p>
<p>Like the axle of the mill, the tree, the skambha, also represents
the world axis. This instinctively suggests a straight, upright post,
but the word axis is a simplification of the real concept. There is the
invisible axis, of course, which is crowned by the North Nail, but
this image needs to be enriched by two more dimensions. The term
world axis is an abbreviation of language comparable to the visual
abbreviation achieved by projecting the reaches of the sky onto a
flat star map. It is best not to think of the axis in straight analytical
terms, one line at a time, but to consider it, and the frame to which
6 See H. Diels, Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker (1951), vol. 1, pp. 412L</p>
<p>233 ' The Frame of the Cosmos</p>
<p>it is connected, as one whole. This involves the use of multivalent
terms and the recognition of a convergent involution of unusual
meanings.</p>
<p>As radius automatically calls circle to mind, so axis must invoke
the two determining great circles on the surface of the sphere, the
equinoctial and solstitial colures. Pictured this way, the axis resem¬
bles a complete armillary sphere. It stands for the system of coor¬
dinates of the sphere and represents the frame of a world-age.
Actually the frame defines a world-age. Because the polar axis and
the colures form an indivisible whole, the entire frame is thrown
out of kilter if one part is moved. When that happens, a new Pole
star with appropriate colures of its own must replace the obsolete
apparatus.</p>
<p>Thus the Sanskrit skambha, the world pillar, ancestor of the
Finnish Sampo, is shown to be an integral element in the scheme
of things. The hymn 10 .7 of the Atharva Veda is dedicated to the
skambha, and Whitney, its translator and commentator 7 sounds
puzzled in his footnote to /0.7.2: “Skambha, lit. ‘prop, support,
pillar,’ strangely used in this hymn as frame of the universe or held
personified as its soul.” Here are two verses of it:</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>
<p>In whom earth, atmosphere, in whom sky is set, where fire, moon,
sun, wind stand fixed, that Skambha tell . . .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Skambha sustains both heaven-and-earth here; the skambha
sustains the wide atmosphere, the skambha sustains the six wide
directions; into the skambha entered this whole existence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The good old Sampo sounds less pretentious, but it does have its
three “roots,” “one in heaven, one in the earth, one in the water-
eddy.” 8 To make a drawing of a pillarlike tree (let alone a mill),
with its roots distributed in the manner indicated, would be quite a
task. Notably it takes the “enormous bull of Pohja”—obviously a
cosmic bull—to plow up these strange roots: the Finnish heroes by
themselves had not been able to uproot the Sampo.</p>
<p>In the case of Yggdrasil, the World Ash, Rydberg tried his hard¬
est to localize the three roots, to imagine and to draw them. Since he</p>
<p>7 Harvard Oriental Series, vol. 8, p. 590.</p>
<p>8 K. Krohn, Kalevalastudien 4. Sampo (1927), p. 13.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 234</p>
<p>looked with steadfast determination into the interior of our globe,
the result was not overly convincing. One of the roots is said to
belong to the Asa in heaven, and beneath it is the most sacred foun¬
tain of Urd. The second is to be found in the quarters of the frost-
giants “where Ginnungagap formerly was,” and where the well of
Alimir now is. The third root belongs to Niflheim, the realm of the
dead, and under this root is Hvergelmer, the Whirlpool (Gy If . 15). 9</p>
<p>This precludes any terrestrial diagram. It looks as though the
“axis,” implicating the equinoctial and solstitial colures, runs
through the “three worlds” which are, to state it roughly and most
inaccurately, the following:</p>
<p>(a) the sky north of the Tropic of Cancer, i.e., the sky proper, do¬
main of the gods</p>
<p>(b) the “inhabited world” of the zodiac between the Tropics, the
domain of the “living”</p>
<p>(c) the sky south from the Tropic of Capricorn, alias the Sweet-
Water Ocean, the realm of the dead.</p>
<p>The demarcation plane between solid earth and sea is represented
by the celestial equator; hence half of the zodiac is under “water,”
the southern ecliptic, bordered by the equinoctial points. There
are more refined subdivisions, to be sure, “zones” or “belts” or
“climates,” dividing the sphere from north to south and, most im¬
portant, the “sky” as well as the waters of the south have a share
in the “inhabited world” allotted to them. 10 This summary is an
almost frivolous simplification, but for the time being it may be
sufficient.</p>
<p>9 We are aware that either Grotte “should” have three roots, or that Yggdrasil
should be uprooted, and that the Finns do not tell how the maelstrom came into
being. All of which can be explained; we wish, however, to avoid dragging more
and more material into the case. Several ages of the world have passed away, and
they do not perish all in the same manner; e.g., the Finns know of the destruction
of Sampo and of the felling of the huge Oak.</p>
<p>10 To clear up the exact range of the three worlds, it would be necessary to
work out the whole history of the Babylonian “Ways of Anu, Enlil, and Ea” (cf.
pp. 43if.), and how these “Ways” were adapted, changed, and defined anew
by the many heirs of ancient oriental astronomy. And then we would not
yet be wise to the precise whereabouts of Air, Saltwater, and other ambiguous
items.</p>
<p>235 * The Frame of the Cosmos</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is necessary to explain again what this “earth” is
that modern interpreters like to take for a pancake. The mythical
earth is, in fact, a plane, but this plane is not our “earth” at all,
neither our globe, nor a presupposed homocentrical earth. “Earth”
is the implied plane through the four points of the year, marked by
the equinoxes and solstices, in other words the ecliptic. And this is
why this earth is very frequently said to be quadrangular. The four
“corners,” that is, the zodiacal constellations rising heliacally at both
the equinoxes and solstices, parts of the “frame” skambha, are the
points which determine an “earth.” Every world-age has its own
“earth.” It is for this very reason that “ends of the world” are said
to take place. A new “earth” arises, when another set of zodiacal
constellations brought in by the Precession determines the year
points.</p>
<p>Once the reader has made the adjustment needed to think of the
frame instead of the “pillar” he will understand easily many queer
scenes which would be strictly against nature—ideas about planets
performing feats at places which are out of their range, as both the
poles are. He will understand why a force planning to uproot (or
to chop down) a tree, or to unhinge a mill, or merely pull out a
plug, or a pin, does not have to go “up”—or “down”—all the way
to the pole to do it. The force causes the same effect when it pulls
out the nearest available part of the “frame” within the inhabited
world.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the manipulation of the frame, begin¬
ning with a most insignificant survival. Actually this is a useful
approach, because the less meaningful the example, the more aston¬
ishing is the fact of its surviving. Turkmen tribes of southern
Turkestan tell about a copper pillar marking the “navel of the
earth,” and they state that “only the nine-year-old hero Kara Par
is able to lift and to extract” it. 11 As goes without saying, nobody
comments on the strange idea that someone should be eager to
“extract the navel of the earth.” When Young Arthur does it with
Excalibur, the events have already been fitted into a more familiar
frame and they provoke no questions.</p>
<p>n Radloff, quoted by W. E. Roscher, Der Omphalosgedanke (1918), pp. if.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 236</p>
<p>In its grandiose style, the Mahabharata presents a similar prodigy
as follows:</p>
<p>It w as Vishvamitra who in anger created a second world and numer¬
ous stars beginning with Sravana . . . He can burn the three worlds
by his splendour, can, by stamping (his foot), cause the Earth to
quake. He can sever the great Meru from the Earth and hurl it to any
distance. He can go round the 10 points of the Earth in a moment . 12</p>
<p>Vishvamitra is one of the seven stars of the Big Dipper, this at
least has been found out. But each planet is represented by a star of
the Wain, and vice versa, so this case does not look particularly
helpful. 13</p>
<p>A cosmic event of the first order can be easily overlooked when
it hides modestly in a fairy tale. The following, taken from the
Indian “Ocean of Stories,” tells of Shiva: “When he drove his tri¬
dent into the heart of Andhaka, the king of the Asuras, though he
was only one, the dart which that monarch had infixed into the
heart of the three worlds was, strange to say, extracted.” 14</p>
<p>A plot can also shrink to unrecognizable insignificance when it</p>
<p>12 AIbh. 7.71, Roy trans., vol. /, p. 171.</p>
<p>13 The notion of “numerous [newly appointed] stars beginning with Sravana”
should enlighten us. Sravana, “the Lame,” is, in the generally accepted order, the
twenty-first lunar mansion, alpha beta gamma Aquilae, also called by the name
Ashvatta , which stands for a sacred fig tree but which means literally “below which
the horses stand” (Scherer, Gestirnnamen , p. 158), and which invites a comparison
with Old Norse Yggdrasil, meaning “the tree below which Odin’s horse grazes”
(Reuter, Germanische Himmelskunde , p. 236). Actually, the solstitial colure ran
through alpha beta gamma Aquilae around 300 b.c., and long after the time when
it used to pass through one or the other of the stars of the Big Dipper; the
equinoctial colure, however, comes down very near eta Ursae Alajoris. Consider¬
ing that eta maintains the most cordial relations with Alars in occidental astrology,
Vishvamitra might be eta, and might represent Alars, and that would go well
with the violent character of this Rishi. But even if we accept this for a working
hypothesis, there remains the riddle of the “second world,” i.e., “second” with
respect to which “first” world? Although we have a hunch, we are not going to
try to solve it here and now. Two pieces of information should be mentioned,
however: (1) AIbh. 74.44 (Roy trans., vol. 12 , p. 83) states: “The constellations
[= lunar mansions, nakshatras ] have Sravana for their first”; (2) Sengupta (in
Burgess’ trans. of Surya Siddhanta , p. xxxiv) claims that “the time of the present
redaction of the Mahabharata ” was called “Sravanadi kala, i.e., the time when the
winter solstitial colure passed through the nakshatra Sravana.”</p>
<p>14 N. AI. Penzer, The Ocean of Story (1924), vol. /, p. 3.</p>
<p>237 # The Frame of the Cosmos</p>
<p>comes disguised as history, but this next story at least has been
pinned down to the proper historical character, and even has been
checked by a serious military historian like Arrianus, who tells us
the following:</p>
<p>Alexander, then, reached Gordium, and was seized with an ardent
desire to ascend to the acropolis, where was the palace of Gordius and
his son Midas, and to look at Gordius’ wagon and the knot of the
chariot’s yoke. There was a widespread tradition about this chariot
around the countryside; Gordius, they said, was a poor man of the
Phrygians of old, who tilled a scanty parcel of earth and had but two
yoke of oxen: with one he ploughed, with the other he drove his
wagon. Once, as he was ploughing, an eagle settled on the yoke and
stayed, perched there, till it was time to loose the oxen; Gordius was
astonished at the portent, and went off to consult the Telmissian
prophets, who were skilled in the interpretation of prodigies, inherit¬
ing—women and children too—the prophetic gift. Approaching a
Telmissian village, he met a girl drawing water and told her the story
of the eagle: she, being also of the prophetic line, bade him return to
the spot and sacrifice to Zeus the King. So then Gordius begged her
to come along with him and assist in the sacrifice; and at the spot duly
sacrificed as she directed, married the girl, and had a son called Midas.</p>
<p>Midas was already a grown man, handsome and noble, when the
Phrygians were in trouble with civil war; they received an oracle
that a chariot would bring them a king and he would stop the war.
True enough, while they were discussing this, there arrived Midas,
with his parents, and drove, chariot and all, into the assembly. The
Phrygians, interpreting the oracle, decided that he was the man
whom the gods had told them would come in a chariot; they there¬
upon made him king, and he put an end to the civil war. The chariot
of his father he set up in the acropolis as a thank-offering to Zeus the
king for sending the eagle.</p>
<p>Over and above this there was a story about the wagon, that anyone
who should untie the knot of the yoke should be lord of Asia. This
knot was of cornel bark, and you could see neither beginning nor
end of it. Alexander, unable to find how to untie the knot, and not
brooking to leave it tied, lest this might cause some disturbance in
the vulgar, smote it with his sword, cut the knot, and exclaimed, “I
have loosed it!”—so at least say some, but Aristobulus puts it that
he took out the pole pin , a dowel driven right through the pole, hold¬
ing the knot together, and so removed the yoke from the pole. I do
not attempt to be precise how Alexander actually dealt with this
knot. Anyway, he and his suite left the wagon with the impression</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 238</p>
<p>that the oracle about the loosed knot had been duly fulfilled. It is
certain that there were that night thundcrings and lightnings, which
indicated this; so Alexander in thanksgiving offered sacrifice next day
to whatever gods had sent the signs and certified the undoing of the
knot . 15</p>
<p>Without going now into the relevant comparative material it
should be stressed that in those cases where “kings” are sitting in a
wagon (Greek hai/iaxa), i.e., a four-wheeled truck, it is most of the
time Charles' Wain.</p>
<p>Alexander was a true myth builder, or rather, a true myth-
attracting magnet. He had a gift for attracting to his fabulous per¬
sonality the manifold tradition that, once, had been coined for
Gilgamesh.</p>
<p>But the time is not yet ripe either for Alexander or for Gilga¬
mesh, nor for further statements about deities or heroes who could
pull out pins, plugs and pillars. The next concern is with the deci¬
sive features of the mythical landscape and their possible localiza¬
tion, or their fixation in time. It is essential to know where and
when the first whirlpool came into being once Grotte, Amlodhi’s
Mill, had been destroyed. This is, however, a misleading expression
because our terminology is still much too imprecise. It would be
better to say the first exit from, or entrance to, the whirlpool. It
appears advisable to recapitulate the bits of information that have
been gathered on the whirlpool as a whole:</p>
<p>The maelstrom, result of a broken mill, a chopped-down tree,
and the like, “goes through the whole globe,” according to the
Finns. So does Tartaros, according to Socrates. To repeat it in
Guthrie’s words: “The earth in this myth of Socrates is spherical,
and Tartaros, the bottomless pit, is represented in this mythical
geography by a chasm which pierces the sphere right through from
side to side.” 16</p>
<p>It is source and mouth of all waters.</p>
<p>It is the way, or one among others, to the realm of the dead.
Medieval geographers call it “Umbilicus Maris,” Navel of the
Sea, or “Euripus.”</p>
<p>^Anabasis of Alexander 2. 3.1-8 (Robson trans., LCL).</p>
<p>16 Orpheus and Greek Religion (1952), p. 168.</p>
<p>239 ’ The Frame of the Cosmos</p>
<p>Antiochus the astrologer calls Eridanus proper, or some abstract
topos not far from Sirius, “zalos,” i.e., whirlpool.</p>
<p>M. W. Makemson looks for the Polynesian whirlpool, said to be
“at the end of the sky,” “at the edge of the Galaxy,” in Sagittarius.</p>
<p>A Dyak hero, climbing a tree in “Whirlpool-Island,” lands him¬
self in the Pleiades.</p>
<p>But generally, one looks for “it” in the more or less northwest-
north-northwest direction, a direction where, equally vaguely,
Kronos-Saturn is supposed to sleep in his golden cave notwithstand¬
ing the blunt statements (by Homer) that Kronos was hurled down
into deepest Tartaros.</p>
<p>And from those “infernal” quarters, particularly from the (Ogy-
gian) Stygian landscape, “one”—who else but the souls?—sees the
celestial South Pole, invisible to us.</p>
<p>The reader might agree that this summary shows clearly the
insufficiency of the general terminology accepted by the majority.
The verbal confusion provokes sympathy for Numenius (see above,
p. 188), and the Third Vatican Mythographer who took the rivers
for planets, their planetary orbs respectively. We think that the
whirlpool stands for the “ecliptical world” marked by the whirling
planets, embracing everything which circles obliquely with respect
to the polar axis and the equator—oblique by 23V2 degrees, more
or less, each planet having its own obliquity with respect to the
others and to the sun’s path, that is, the ecliptic proper. It has been
mentioned earlier (p. 206, n. 5) that in the axis of the Roman circus
was a Euripus , and altars of the three outer planets (Saturn, Jupiter,
Mars), and the three inner planets (Venus, Mercury, Moon) on
both sides of the pyramid of the sun, and that there were not more
than seven circuits because the “planets are seven only.”</p>
<p>The ecliptic as a whirl is only one aspect of the famous “implex.”
It must be kept in mind that being the seat of all planetary powers,
it represented, so to speak, the “Establishment” itself. There is no
better symbol of the thinking of those planet-struck Mesopotamian
civilizations than the arrogant plan of the royal cities themselves,
as it has been patiently reconstructed by generations of Orientalists
and archaeologists. Nineveh proclaimed itself as the seat of stable</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill •</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>order and power by its seven-times crenellated circle of walls, col¬
ored with the seven planetary colors, and so thick that chariots
could run along the top. The planetary symbolism spread to India,
as was seen in chapter VIII, and culminated in that prodigious
cosmological diagram that is the temple of Barabudur in Java. 17 It is
still evident in the innumerable stupas which dot the Indian country¬
side, whose superimposed crowns stand for the planetary heavens.
And here we have the Establishment seen as a Way Up and Be¬
yond, as Numenius would have seen immediately, the succession
of spheres of transition for the soul, a quiet promise of transcen¬
dence which marks the Gnostic and Hinduistic scheme. The skele¬
ton map will always lack one or the other dimension. The Whirl is
then a way up or a way down? Heraclitus would say both ways
are one and the same. You cannot put into a scheme everything at
once.</p>
<p>This general conception of the whirlpool as the “ecliptical
world” does not, of course, help to understand any single detail.
Starting from the idea of the whirlpool as a way to the other world,
one must look at the situation through the eyes of a soul meaning
to go there. It has to move from the interior outwards, to “ascend”
from the geocentric earth through the planetary spheres “up” to the
fixed sphere, that is, right through the whole whirlpool, the eclip¬
tical world. But in order to leave the ecliptical frame, there must
be a station for changing trains at the equator. One would expect
this station to be at the crossroads of ecliptical and equatorial coor¬
dinates at the equinoxes. But evidently, this was not the arrange¬
ment. A far older route was followed. It is true that it sometimes
looks as though the transfer point were at the equinoxes. The astro¬
logical tradition that followed Teukros, 18 for example, provided
a rich offering of celestial locations for Hades, the Acherusian lake,
Charon the ferryman, etc., all of them under the chapter Libra.
But this is a trap and one can only hope that many hapless souls
have not been deceived. For these astrological texts mean the sign</p>

of these star groups.</p>

<p>Libra, not the constellation. All “change stations” are found in¬
variably in two regions: one in the South between Scorpius and
Sagittarius, the other in the North between Gemini and Taurus;
and this is valid through time and space, from Babylon to Nica¬
ragua. 19 Why was it ever done in the first place? Because of the
Galaxy, which has its crossroads with the ecliptic between Sagit¬
tarius and Scorpius in the South, and between Gemini and Taurus
in the North.</p>
<p>19 The notion is not even foreign to the cheering adventures of Swi, the Chinese
Monkey (Wou Tch’eng Ngen , French trans. by Louis Avenol [1957]). One day,
two “harponneurs des morts” get hold of him, claiming that he has arrived at the
term of his destiny, and is ripe for the underworld. He escapes, of course. The
translator remarks (vol. /, p. iii) that it is the constellation Nan Teou, the Southern
Dipper, that decides everybody’s death, and the orders are executed by these
“harponneurs des morts.” The Southern Dipper consists of the stars mu lambda
phi sigma tau zeta Sagittarii (cf. G. Schlegel, VUranographie Chinoise [1875], pp.
172#.; L. de Saussure, Les Origines de /’Astronomie Chinoise [1930], pp. 452L).</p>
