  <p>For from today new feasts and

<p>Because tonight is born Shah Kai
Khusrau</p>
<p>Shahnama</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>J_ he Hamlet theme moves now to Persia. Firdausi’s Shahnama,
the Book of Kings, is the national epic of Iran, 1 and Firdausi
(ca. a.d. 1010) is still today the national poet. At the time Firdausi
wrote, his protector, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna, had shifted the
center of his power to India, and the Iranian empire had long been
only a memory. With prodigious scholarship, Firdausi, like Homer
before him, undertook to organize and record the Zendic tradition,
which extended back from historic times into the purely mythical.
The first section on the Pishdadian and Kaianian dynasties must be
considered mythical throughout, although it does reach into his¬
toric times and encompasses four of the nine volumes of the Book
of Kings in the English translation. Khusrau (Chosroes in Greek) is
also the name of a line of historical rulers, one of whom, Khusrau
Anushirvan, gave sanctuary to the last philosophers of Greece, the
members of the Platonic Academy driven out by Justinian in
a.d. 529. But Firdausi’s Kai Khusrau is the towering figure of his
own mythical age. Almost one-fifth of the whole work is allotted
to him. He is actually the Haosravah of the Z end Avesta, and also</p>
<p>1 We cite here the English translation of Arthur and Edward Warner (1905-
1909).</p>
<p>37 • The Iranian Parallel</p>
<p>the Rigvedic Sushravah, an identity which raises again the much
discussed question of a common Indo-European “Urzeit,'’ the time
of origins.</p>
<p>The common features of Saxo’s Amlethus and Kai Khusrau are
so striking that Jiriczek, and after him Zenker, undertook detailed
comparative studies. 2 But they concluded that the Greek saga of
Bellerophon might provide a common origin, and that was the end
of their quest. Classical antiquity has a magnetic quality for the
scholarly mind. It acts upon it like the Great Lodestone Mountain
in Sindbad. The frail philological bark comes apart as soon as
Greece looms over the horizon. Bellerophon’s somber tale would
provide a parallel too, but does that have to be the end of the trail?
As Herodotus ruefully remarks, his own Hellenic antiquity goes
back in recorded memory but a few centuries; beyond that, it
blends with the Indo-European patrimony of legends.</p>
<p>In the vast flow of the Shahnama, one prominent feature is the
perpetual war between “Untamo” and “Kalervo,” here the two
rival peoples of Turan and Iran. Because the vicissitudes of the
Kaianian dynasty of Iran are spread over a narrative twice as long
as both epics of Milton combined, it is necessary here to concentrate
on one essential aspect.</p>
<p>The Iranian plot shows some “displacement” in that Afrasiyab
the Turanian kills, instead of his brother, his nephew Siyawush who
is also his son-in-law, so that the “avenger” of this crime is bound
to come forth as the common grandson of the hostile Turanian
Shah Afrasiyab and his brother, the noble Iranian Shah Kai Ka’us
(the same one who plays no small role in the Rigveda as Kavya
Ushanas, and in the Avesta as Kavi Usan). Siyawush, as commander
of his father’s army, offers peace to the Turanian Afrasiyab, who
accepts the offer because he has had a catastrophic dream. 3 This
dream resembles those of Tarquin and Ambales. Kai Ka&rsquo;us does not
trust Afrasiyab and declines peace. Siyawush, not wishing to break
his own treaty with Turan, goes to live with Afrasiyab.</p>

<p>Afrasiyab honors the young man in every way, and gives him a
large province which he rules excellently, i.e., in the “Golden Age”
style of his father Kai Ka’us. Siyawush marries first a daughter of
the Turanian Piran, then Shah Afrasiyab gives him his own
daughter Farangis. But there is a serpent in that garden. Afrasiyab’s
jealous brother Garsiwas, an early Polonius, plots so successfully
against Siyawush that Afrasiyab finally sends an army against the
blameless young ruler. Siyawush is captured and killed. The wid¬
owed Farangis escapes, accompanied by Piran (Siyawush’s first
father-in-law) to Piran’s home where she gives birth to a boy of
great beauty, Kai Khusrau, Afrasiyab’s and Kai Ka’us’ common
grandson:</p>
<p>One dark and moonless night, while birds, wild beasts
And cattle slept, Piran in dream beheld
A spletidour that outshone the sun itself,</p>
<p>While Siyawush, enthroned and sword in hand,</p>
<p>Called loudly to him saying: “Rest no more!</p>
<p>Throw off sweet sleep and think of times to come .</p>
<p>For from today new feasts and customs date,</p>
<p>Because to-night is born Shah Kai Khusrau!&quot;</p>
<p>The chieftain roused him from his sweet repose:</p>
<p>Gulshahr the sunny-faced woke . Piran
Said unto her: “Arise, Betake thyself
To minister to Farangis, for I
Saw Siyawush in sleep a moment since,</p>
<p>Surpassing both the sun and ?noon in lustre,</p>
<p>And crying: ‘Sleep no more, but join the feast
Of Kai Khusrau, the monarch of the world!' &quot;</p>
<p>Gulshahr came hasting to the Moon and saw
The prince already born; she went with cries
Of joy that made the palace ring again
Back to Pira?i the chief . “Thou wouldest say,&quot;</p>
<p>She cried, “that kmg and Moon are fairly matched/” 4</p>

<p>;9 * The Iranian Parallel</p>
<p>With this prophetic dream of a great new age begins a long time
of trials for the predestined hero. The boy grows up among the
shepherds; he becomes a great hunter with a crude bow and arrows
that he makes for himself without arrowheads or feathers, like
Hamlet whittling his stakes. Grandfather Afrasiyab. being afraid of
the boy. orders the prince brought to him so that he can convince
himself his victim is harmless. Although Afrasiyab has sworn sol¬
emnly not to hurt Khusrau. Piran urges the boy to play the village
idiot for his own safety. YHien the tyrant questions him with
feigned benevolence. Kai Khusrau answers in the very same style as
Amlethus did. in riddles which sound senseless and indicate that
young Khusrau likens himself to a dog. The usurper feels relieved:
“The fellow is a fool!”</p>
<p>Now. the tale of vengeance, unduly abbreviated by Saxo&rsquo;s report
and in other versions, is told by Firdausi with an appropriately
majestic setting and on a grand scale. The anger of Iran and the
world, stemming from the death of Siyawush. is orchestrated apo¬
calyptically into a cosmic tumult:</p>
<p>The world was all revenge and thou hadst said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a seething sea. r Earth had no room
For walking , air was ambushed by the spears;</p>
<p>The stars began to fray , and time and earth
Washed hands in mischief .. . 5</p>
<p>Still, the two archcriminals manage to escape and hide with inex¬
haustible resourcefulness. Afrasiyab even plays Proteus in the waters
of a deep salt lake, constantly assuming new shapes to evade cap¬
ture. Finally, two volumes and a multitude of events later. Afrasiyab
and the evil counsellor are caught with a lasso or a net and both
perish.</p>
<p>Only by going back to the Avestan tradition can one make sense
of the many vicissitudes to which the Yashts or hymns of the
A vesta allude repeatedly. 6 The Shahs Kai Khusrau and Afrasiyab</p>
<p>5 Firdausi. Warner trans., vol. r. p. 54:.</p>
<p>6 Yasht 541-49: 75.56-64.. -4.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 40</p>
<p>were contending in a quest for the enigmatic Hvarna, rendered as
the “Glory,” or the Charisma of Fortune. To obtain it the Shahs
kept sacrificing a hundred horses, a thousand oxen, ten thousand
lambs to the goddess Anahita, who is a kind of Ishtar-Artemis. Now
this Glory “that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn,
and to the holy Zarathustra” was in Lake Vurukasha. Afrasiyab,
Shah of the non-Aryan Turanians, was not entitled to it. But leav¬
ing his hiding place in an underground palace of iron “a thousand
times the height of man” and illuminated by artificial sun, moon
and stars, he tried three times to capture the Hvarna, plunging into
Lake Vurukasha. However, “the Glory escaped, the Glory fled
away, the Glory changed its seat.” There will be more discussion
of Afrasiyab’s attempts and his “horrible utterances,” in the chapter
“Of Time and the Rivers.” The Glory was, instead, allotted to Kai
Khusrau, and it was bestowed upon him without much ado. At this
point it is fair to say that Hvarna stands for Legitimacy, or
Heavenly Mandate, which is granted to rulers, but is also easily
withdrawn. Yima (Jamshyd), the earliest “world ruler,” lost it
three times.</p>
<p>The story of diving Afrasiyab has had many offshoots in Eurasian
folklore. There the Turanian Shah is spelled “Devil,” and God
causes him to dive to the bottom of the sea, so that in the meantime
one of the archangels, or St. Elias, can steal a valuable object which
is the legal property of the Devil. Sometimes the object is the sun,
sometimes the “divine power,” or thunder and lightning, or even a
treaty between God and Devil which had turned out to be un¬
profitable for God.</p>
<p>There remains the essential denouement. During those eventful
years, Kai Ka’us held joint rulership with his grandson, secure in
the Glory. Shortly after the victory over the upstart, Kai Ka’us dies
and Kai Khusrau ascends the Ivory Throne. For sixty years, says
the poem, “the whole world was obedient to his sway.” It is strik¬
ing that there is no word of any event after Kai Ka’us’ death. May¬
be it is because all has been achieved. Happy reigns have no history.
But it is told that Kai Khusrau falls into deep melancholy and soul-</p>
<p>1</p>

<p>searching. 7 He fears he may “grow arrogant in soul, corrupt in
thought” like his predecessors Yima (Jamshyd) and, among others,
Kai Ka’us himself, who had tried to get himself carried to heaven
by eagles like the Babylonian Etana. So he makes the supreme
decision:</p>
<p>“And now I deem it better to depart
To God in all my glory . . .</p>
<p>Because this Kami crown and throne will pass.”</p>
<p>The great Shah, then, who had once stated (at his first joint en¬
thronement) :</p>
<p>“ The whole world is my kingdom , all is mine
From Pisces downward to the Bull&rsquo;s head ” 8</p>
<p>prepares his departure, takes leave of his paladins, waving aside
their supplications and those of his whole army:</p>
<p>A cry rose from the army of Iran:</p>
<p>The sun hath wandered from its way in heaven!</p>
<p>The dream of Tarquin finds here an early echo. The Shah appoints
as his successor Luhrasp and wanders off to a mountaintop, accom¬
panied by five of his paladins, to whom he announces in the eve¬
ning, before they sit down for the last time to talk of the great past
they have lived together:</p>
<p>“ What time the radiant sun shall raise its flag ,</p>
<p>And turn the darksome earth to liquid gold ,</p>
<p>Then is the time when I shall pass away
And haply with Surush 9 for company .”</p>
<p>Toward dawn he addresses his friends once more:</p>
<p>“Farewell for ever! When the sky shall bring
The sun again ye shall not look on me</p>

<p>8 Firdausi, Warner trans., vol. 2 , p. 407.</p>

<p>Henceforth save in your dreams. Moreover be not
Here on the morrow on these arid sands ,</p>
<p>Although the clouds rain musk , for frora the Mountains
Will rise a furious blast and snap the boughs
And leafage of the trees, a storm of snow
Will shower down from heaven&rsquo;s louring rack ,
towards Iran ye will not find the track”</p>
<p>The chieftains' heads were heavy at the news .</p>
<p>The warriors slept in pain, and when the sun
Rose over the hills the Shah had disappeared.</p>
<p>The five paladins are lost and buried in the snowstorm. 10</p>
<p>10 This theme of sleep in the “hour of Gethsemane” will occur more than once,
e.g., in Gilgamesh. The myth of Quetzalcouatl is even more circumstantial. The
exiled ruler is escorted by the dwarves and hunchbacks, who are also lost in the
snow along what is now the Cortez Pass, while their ruler goes on to the sea and
departs. But here at least he promises to come back and judge the living and the
dead.</p>
