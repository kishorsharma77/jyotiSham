  <p>The glacier knocks in the cup¬

<p>The desert sighs in the bed,</p>
<p>And the crack in the tea cup
opens</p>
<p>A lane to the land of the dead.</p>
<p>W. H. Auden, “As I Walked
Out One Evening”</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>X- here is a tradition from Borneo of a “whirlpool island” with
a tree that allows a man to climb up into heaven and bring back
useful seeds from the “land of the Pleiades.” 1 The Polynesians have
not made up their mind, apparently, concerning the exact localiza¬
tion of their whirlpool which serves in most cases as entrance to the
abode of the dead; it is supposed to be found “at the end of the sky,”
and “at the edge of the Milky Way.” 2</p>
<p>On this side of the Atlantic the Cuna Indians also knew the basic
scheme, 3 although they, too, failed to give the accepted localization:
“God’s very own whirlpool” ( tiolele piria ) was right beneath the
Palluwalla tree, “Saltwater-Tree,” and when the Sun-God, or the
Tapir, a slightly disguised Quetzalcouatl, chopped down the tree,
saltwater gushed forth to form the oceans of the world.</p>
<p>1 A. Maass, “Sternkunde und Sterndeuterei im Malaiischen Archipel” (1924), in
Tijdschrift Indische Taal-, Land-, en Volkenkunde 64, p. 388.</p>
<p>2 M. W. Alakemson ( The Morning Star Rises: An Account of Polynesian As¬
tronomy [1941], no. 160) suggests Sagittarius. For Samoa, see A. Kraemer, Die
Sanioa-lnseln (1902), vol. 1, p. 369. For Alangaia, see P. Buck, Mangaian Society
(1934), p. 198; and R. W. Williamson, Religious and Cosmic Beliefs of Central
Polynesia (1924), vol. 2, p. 251.</p>

<p>Hamlet’s Mill •</p>
<p>214</p>
<p>There arc three elements here, which combine into a curious
tangle: (a) the whirlpool represents, or is, the connection of the
world of the living with the world of the dead; (b) a tree grows
close to it, frequently a life-giving or -saving tree; (c) the whirl
came into being because a tree was chopped down or uprooted, or
a mill&rsquo;s axle unhinged, and the like. This basic scheme works into
many variants and features in many parts of the world, and it pro¬
vides a very real paradox or conundrum: it is as if the particular
waters hidden below tree, pillar, or mill’s axle waited only for the
moment when someone should remove that plug—tree, pillar, or
mill’s axle—to play tricks.</p>
<p>This is no newfangled notion. Alfred Jeremias remarks casually,
“The opening of the navel brings the deluge. When David wanted
to remove the navel stone in Jerusalem, a flood was going to start
[see below, p. 220]. In Hierapolis in Syria the altar of Xisuthros
[= Utnapishtim] was shown in the cave where the flood dried up.” 4</p>
<p>The pattern reveals itself in the Indonesian Rama epic. 5 When
Rama is building the huge dike to Lanka (Ceylon) the helpful mon¬
keys throw mountain after mountain into the sea, but all of them
vanish promptly. Enraged, Rama is going to shoot his magic arrow
into the unobliging sea, when there arises a lady from the waters
who warns him that right here was a hole in the ocean leading to
the underworld, and who informs him that the water in that hole
was called Water of Life.</p>
<p>Rama would seem to have won out with his threat since the dike
was built. But the same story comes back in Greece when Herakles
crosses the sea in order to steal the cattle of Geryon. Okeanos,
represented here as a god, works up the waters into a tumult which
are the waters of the original flood; Herakles threatens with his
drawn bow, and calm is re-established.</p>
<p>Neither whirlpool nor confluence are mentioned in these cases,
but they clearly extend to them. This gives great importance to the
Catlo’ltq story from the American Northwest that is paradigmatic
(see chapter XXII) of the maiden who shoots her arrow into the</p>
<p>4 HAOG, p. 156, n. 7 (“wo die Flut versiegte”).</p>

<p>“navel of the waters which was a vast whirlpool,” thus winning
fire. Some very fundamental idea must be lurking behind the story,
and a pretty old one, since it was said of Ishtar that it is “she who
stirs up the apsu before Ea.” 6</p>
<p>A strange pastime for the heavenly queen, but it seems to have
been a rather celestial sport. The eighth Yasht of the Avesta, 7 dedi¬
cated to Sirius-Tishtriya, says of this star: “We worship the splen¬
did, brilliant Tishtriya, which soars rapidly to Lake Vurukasha,
like the arrow quick-as-lightning, which Urxsa the archer, the
best archer among the Aryans, shot from Mount Aryioxsutha to
Mount Huvanvant.” 8 And what does Sirius do to this sea? It causes
“Lake Vurukasha to surge up, to flood asunder, to spread out; at
all shores surges Lake Vurukasha, the whole center surges up” (Yt.
£.31; see also 5-4). Whereas Pliny 9 wants to assure us that “the
whole sea is conscious of the rise of that star, as is most clearly seen
in the Dardanelles, for sea-weed and fishes float on the surface, and
everything is turned up from the bottom.” He also remarks that at</p>

<p>8 See for the feat of this unpronounceable archer (Rkhsha) the report given by
Al-Biruni, who spells him simply Arish (The Chronology of Ancient Nations ,
trans. E. Sachau [1879], p. 205). The background of the tale: Afrasiyab had prom¬
ised to restore to Minocihr a part of Eranshar (which had been conquered by him)
as long and as broad as an arrow shot. Arish shot the arrow on the 13th day of the
month Tir-Mah, after having announced: “I know that when I shoot with this bow
and arrow I shall fall to pieces and my life will be gone.” Accordingly, when he
shot, he “fell asunder into pieces. By order of God the wind bore the arrow away
from the mountain of Ruyan and brought it to the utmost frontier of Khurasan be¬
tween Farghana and Tabaristan; there it hit the trunk of a nut-tree that was so large
that there had never been a tree like it in the world. The distance between the place
where the arrow was shot and that where it fell was 1,000 Farsakh.” (See also
S. H. Taqizadeh, Old Iranian Calendars [1938], p. 44.) Tir or Tira is the name for
Mercury (see T. Hyde, Veterum Fersarum et Parthorum Religio?iis historia [1760],
p. 24: “Tir, i.e., Sagitta . . ., quo etiam nomine appellatur Mercurius Planeta propter
velociorem motum”), but it is also, along with Tishtriya, the name for Sirius (see
A. Scherer, Gestirnna?nen bei den indogermanischen Volkern [1953], pp. 113f.),
and the 13th day of every month is dedicated to Sirius-Tishtriya (see Lommel,
p. 5). We must leave it at that: Sirius-the-arrow has made more mythical “noise”
than any other star, and also its connection with the ominous number 13 appears
to be no Iranian monopoly.</p>

<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 216</p>
<p>the rising of the Dog-Star the wine in the cellars begins to stir up
and that the still waters move (2.107)— an d the Avesta offers as
explanation (Yt. #.41) that it is Tishtriya, indeed, “by whom count
the waters, the still and the flowing ones, those in springs and in
rivers, those in channels and in ponds.” 10</p>
<p>This is, however, no Iranian invention: the ritual text of the
Babylonian New Year addresses Sirius as “ mul KAK.SI.DI. who mea¬
sures the depth of the Sea.” mul is the prefix announcing the star,
KAK.SI.DI means “arrow,” and it is this particular arrow which
is behind most of the bewildering tales of archery. The bow from
which it is sent on its way is a constellation, built from stars of
Argo and Canis Major, which is common to the spheres of Meso¬
potamia, Egypt and China. 11 And since the name Ishtar is shared by
both Venus and Sirius, one may guess who “stirs up the apsu
before Ea.”</p>
<p>And here is what the “fire” accomplished, according to a Finnish
rune of origin, 12 after it had been “cradled . . . over there on the
navel of the sky, on the peak of the famous mountain,” when it
rushed straightaway through seven or nine skies and fell into the
sea: “The spark . . . rolled &hellip; to the bottom of Lake Aloe, roaring
it rushed to the bottom of the sea, down into the narrow depres¬
sion (?). This Lake Aloe then, thrice in the summernight, rose
foaming to the height of its firs, driven in fury beyond its banks.
Thereupon again Lake Aloe thrice in the summernight dried up its
waters to the bottom, its perch on the rocks, its pope [small fishes]
on the skerries.”</p>
<p>A violent spark this seems to have been; yet—is it not also said
of the old Sage: “Vainamoinen in the mouth of the whirlpool boils
like fire in water”? 13 Which goes to show that mythical “fire” means
more than meets the eye. Actually, the enigmatical events in “Lake</p>

and the coming into being of the “three outlets,” the first of which
had the name Hausravah/Kai Khusrau (see chapter XIII, “Of Time
and the Rivers,” p. 201).</p>
<p>Before we move on to many motifs which will be shown as
related to the same “eddy-field” or whirl, it is appropriate to quote
in full a version of the fire and water story from the Indians of
Guyana. This not only provides charming variations, but presents
that rarest of deities, a creator power neither conceited nor touchy
nor jealous nor quarrelsome nor eager to slap down unfortunates
with “inborn sin,” but a god aware that his powers are not really
unlimited. He behaves modestly, sensibly and thoughtfully and is
rewarded with heartfelt cooperation from his creatures, at least
from all except for the usual lone exception.</p>
<p>The Ackawois of British Guiana say that in the beginning of the
world the great spirit Makonaima [or Makunaima; he is a twin-hero;
the other is called Pia] created birds and beasts and set his son Sigu to
rule over them. iMoreover, he caused to spring from the earth a great
and very wonderful tree, which bore a different kind of fruit on each
of its branches, while round its trunk bananas, plantains, cassava,
maize, and corn of all kinds grew in profusion; yams, too, clustered
round its roots; and in short all the plants now cultivated on earth
flourished in the greatest abundance on or about or under that mar¬
vellous tree.</p>
<p>In order to diffuse the benefits of the tree all over the world, Sigu
resolved to cut it down and plant slips and seeds of it everywhere, and
this he did with the help of all the beasts and birds, all except the
brown monkey , who, being both lazy and mischievous, refused to
assist in the great work of transplantation. So to keep him out of
mischief Sigu set the animal to fetch water from the stream in a basket
of open-work, calculating that the task would occupy his misdirected
energies for some time to come.</p>
<p>In the meantime, proceeding with the labour of felling the miraculous
tree, he discovered that the stump was hollow and full of water in
which the fry of every sort of fresh-water fish was swimming about.
The benevolent Sigu determined to stock all the rivers and lakes on
earth with the fry on so liberal a scale that every sort of fish should
swarm in every water.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 218</p>
<p>But this generous intention was unexpectedly frustrated. For the
water in the cavity, being connected with the great reservoir some¬
where in the bowels of the earth, began to overflow; and to arrest the
rising flood Sigu covered the stump with a closely woven basket. This
had the desired effect. But unfortunately the brown monkey, tired of
his fruitless task, stealthily returned, and his curiosity being aroused
by the sight of the basket turned upside down, he imagined that it
must conceal something good to eat. So he cautiously lifted it and
peeped beneath, and out poured the flood , sweeping the monkey him¬
self away and inundating the whole land. Gathering the rest of the
animals together Sigu led them to the highest points of the country,
where grew some tall coconut-palms. Up the tallest trees he caused
the birds and climbing animals to ascend; and as for the animals that
could not climb and were not amphibious, he shut them in a cave
with a very narrow entrance, and having sealed up the mouth of it
with wax he gave the animals inside a long thorn with which to pierce
the wax and so ascertain when the water had subsided. After taking
these measures for the preservation of the more helpless species, he
and the rest of the creatures climbed up the palm-tree and ensconced
themselves among the branches.</p>
<p>During the darkness and storm which followed, they all suffered in¬
tensely from cold and hunger; the rest bore their sufferings with
stoical fortitude, but the red howling monkey uttered his anguish in
such horrible yells that his throat swelled and has remained distended
ever since; that, too, is the reason why to this day he has a sort of
bony drum in his throat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sigu from time to time let fall seeds of the palm into the
water to judge of its depth by the splash. As the water sank, the
interval between the dropping of the seed and the splash in the water
grew longer; and at last, instead of a splash the listening Sigu heard
the dull thud of the seeds striking the soft earth. Then he knew that
the flood had subsided, and he and the animals prepared to descend.
But the trumpeter-bird was in such a hurry to get down that he
flopped straight into an ant’s nest, and the hungry insects fastened on
his legs and gnawed them to the bone. That is why the trumpeter-
bird has still such spindle shanks. The other creatures profited by this
awful example and came down the tree cautiously and safely.</p>
<p>Sigu now rubbed two pieces of wood together to make fire , but just
as he produced the first spark, he happened to look away, and the
bush-turkey, mistaking the spark for a fire-fly, gobbled it up and
flew off. The spark burned the greedy bird’s gullet, and that is why
turkeys have red wattles on their throats to this day.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>219 • The Waters jrom the Deep</p>
<p>The alligator was standing by at the time, doing no harm to anybody;
but as he was for some reason an unpopular character, all the other
animals accused him of having stolen and swallowed the spark. In
order to recover the spark from the jaws of the alligator Sigu tore out
the animal’s tongue, and that is why alligators have no tongue to
speak of down to this very day. 14</p>
<p>There are many more stories over the world of a plug whose
removal causes the flood: with the Agaria, an ironsmith tribe of
Central India, it is the breaking of a nail of iron which causes their
Golden Age town of Lohripur to be flooded. 15 According to the
Mongolians, the Pole star is “a pillar from the firm standing of
which depends the correct revolving of the world, or a stone which
closes an opening: if the stone is pulled out, water pours out of the
opening to submerge the earth.” 16 In the Babylonian myth of
Utnapishtim, “Nergal [the God of the Underworld] tears out
the posts; forth comes Ninurta and causes the dikes to follow”
(GE //.ioif.). But the new thing to be faced is the appearance of
the Ark in the flood, Noah’s or another’s.</p>
<p>The first ark was built by Utnapishtim in the Sumerian myth;
one learns in different ways that it was a cube—a modest one, mea¬
suring 60 x 60 x 60 fathoms, which represents the unit in the sexa¬
gesimal system where 60 is written as 1. In another version, there
is no ark, just a cubic stone, upon which rests a pillar which reaches
from earth to heaven. The stone, cubic or not, is lying under a
cedar, or an oak, ready to let loose a flood, without obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Confusing as it is, this seems to provide the new theme. In Jewish
legends, it is told that “since the ark disappeared there was a stone
in its place . . . which was called foundation stone.” It was called
foundation stone “because from it the world was founded [or
started].” And it is said to lie above the Waters that are below the
Holy of Holies.</p>

<p>This might look like a dream sequence, but it is buttressed by a
very substantial tradition, taken up by the Jews but to be found
also in Finno-Ugrian tradition. 17 The Jewish story then goes on:</p>
<p>When David was digging the foundations of the Temple, a shard was
found at a depth of 1500 cubits. David was about to lift it when the
shard exclaimed: “Thou canst not do it.” “Why not?” asked David.
“Because I rest upon the abyss.” “Since when?” “Since the hour in
which the voice of God was heard to utter the words from Sinai, ‘I
am the Lord, your God,’ causing the world to quake and sink into the
Abyss. I lie here to cover up the Abyss.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless David lifted the shard, and the waters of the Abyss
rose and threatened to flood the earth. Ahithophel was standing by
and he thought to himself: “Now David shall meet with his death and
I shall be king.” Just then David said: “Whoever knows how to stem
the tide of waters and fails to do it, will one day throttle himself.”</p>
<p>Thereupon Ahithophel had the name of God inscribed upon the
shard, and the shard thrown into the Abyss. The waters at once com¬
menced to subside, but they sank to so great a depth that David
feared the earth might lose her moisture, and he began to sing the
fifteen “Songs of Ascents,” to bring the waters up again.</p>
<p>The foundation stone here has become a shard and its name in
tradition is Eben Shetiyyah, which is derived from a verb of many
meanings: 18 “to be settled, satisfied; to drink; to fix the warp, to lay
the foundations of,” among which “to fix the warp” is the most
revealing, and a reminder of the continuing importance of “frames.”
Within that “frame” there is a surging up and down of the waters
below (as in the Phaedo myth) which suggests catastrophes un¬
recorded by history but indicated only by the highly colored termi¬
nology of cosmologists. Had they only known of a Cardan suspen¬
sion, the world might have been conceived as more stable.</p>
<p>Hildegard Lewy’s researches 19 on Eben Shetiyyah brought up a
passage in the Annals of Assur-nasir-apli in which the new temple</p>

<p>• The Waters from the Deep</p>
<p>of Xinurta at Kalhu is described as founded at the depth of 120
layers of bricks down 4 *to the level of the waters,” or, down to the
water table. This comes back to the waters of the deep in their
natural setting. But what people saw in them is something else
again. If David and the Assyrian king dug down to subsoil water,
so did the builders of the Ka&rsquo;aba in Mecca. In the interior of that
most holy of all shrines there is a well, across the opening of which
had been placed, in pre-Islamic times, the statue of the god I lubal.
Al-Biruni says that in the early Islamic period this was a real well,
where pilgrims could quench their thirst at least at the time of the
Arab pilgrimage. The statue of I lubal had been meant to stop the’
waters from rising. According to the legends, the same belief had
once been current in Jerusalem. Hence the holy shard. But Mecca
tells more. Ilildegard Lewy points out that, in pre-Islamic days, the
god Hubal was Saturn, and that the Holy Stone of the Ka’aba had
the same role, for it was a cube, and hence originally Saturn. Kep¬
ler&rsquo;s polyhedron inscribed in the sphere of Saturn is only the last
witness of an age-old tradition.</p>
<p>The humble little shard was brought in by pious legend to try to
say that what counted was the power of the I loly Name. But the
real thing was the cube: either as Utnapishtim&rsquo;s ark or, in other
versions, as a stone upon which rests a pillar which reaches from
earth to heaven. Even Christ is compared to “a cube-shaped moun¬
tain, upon which a tower is erected.” 20 Hocart writes that ‘‘the
Sinhalese frequently placed inside their topes a square stone repre¬
senting Meru. If they placed in the center of a tope a stone repre¬
senting the center of the world it must have been that they took the
tope to represent the world&rdquo; 11 —which goes without saying. But it
is said otherwise that this stone, the foundation stone, lies under a
great tree, and that from under the stone “a wave rose up to the
sky.”</p>
<p>This sounds like a late mixture, with no reasons given; the way
to unscramble the original motifs is to take them separately.</p>

Werdegznge der abendLindischen Kaisermystik [ 19:4], p. 53).</p>

<p>222</p>
<p>But first, some stock-taking is in order at this point. There are a
number of figures to bring together. The brown monkey, father of
mischief in Sigu’s idyllic creation, is familiar under many disguises.
He is the Serpent of Eden, the lone dissenter. He is Loke who
persuaded the mistletoe not to weep over Balder’s death, thus
breaking the unanimity of creatures. Sigu himself, benevolent king
of the Golden Age, is an unmistakably Saturnian figure, who dwelt
among his creatures, and so is Iahwe, at least when he still “walked
with Adam in the garden.” A ruler who “means well” is a Saturnian
character. No one but Saturn dwelt among men. Says an Orphic
fragment: “Orpheus reminds us that Saturn dwelt openly on earth
and among men.” 22 Dionysius of Halicarnassus (/.36.i) writes:
“Thus before the reign of Zeus, Kronos ruled on this very earth”
to which Maximilian Mayer crisply annotates: “We find no men¬
tion anywhere of such an earthly sojourn on the part of Zeus.” 23
In a similar way, Sandman Holmberg states with respect to Ptah,
the Egyptian Saturn: “The idea of Ptah as an earthly king returns
again and again in Egyptian texts,” and also points to “the remark¬
able fact that Ptah is the only one of the Egyptian gods who is
represented with a straight royal beard, instead of with a bent
beard.” 24</p>
<p>The Saturnalia, from Rome to Mexico, commemorated just this
aspect of Saturn’s rule, with their general amnesties, masters serving
slaves, etc., even if Saturn was not always directly mentioned.
When this festival was due in China, so to speak “sub delta Gemi-
norum”—more correctly, delta and the Gemini stars 61 and 56 of
Flamsteed—“there was a banquet in which all hierarchic distinctions
were set aside . . . The Sovereign invited his subjects through the
‘Song of Stags.’ ” 25</p>
<p>The cube was Saturn’s figure, as Kepler showed in his Mysterium
Cosmographicuvi; this is the reason for the insistence on cubic
stones and cubic arks. Everywhere, the power who warns “Noah”</p>

<p>The Polyhedra inscribed into the planetary orbits. Kepler’s drawing is a pure
geometrical fancy, but it is meant to correspond to the actual relation between
the radii of the planetary orbits. Most important here is the cube, fitted into the
outermost sphere of Saturn.</p>

<p>and urges him to build his ark is Saturn, as Jehovah, as Enid, as
Tane. etc. Sign&rsquo;s basket stopper was obviously an inadequate ver¬
sion of the cube seen through the fantasy of basket-weaving na¬
tives. This leads to the conclusion that Noah&rsquo;s ark originally had a
definite role in bringing the flood to an end. An interesting and
unexpected conclusion for Bible experts.</p>
<p>One of the great motifs of myth is the wondrous tree so often
described as reaching up to heaven. There are many of them—the
Ash Yggdrasil in the Edd.i. the world-darkening oak of the K.i!e-
fj/j. Pherecydes’ world-oak draped with the starry mantle, and the
Tree of Life in Eden. That tree is often cut down. too. The other
motif is the foundation stone, which sometimes becomes a cubic ark.</p>
<p>These motifs must first be traced through. After reading the
beautiful story of Sigu&rsquo;s wonder tree, in whose stump are all the
kinds of fish to populate the world, it needs patience to cope with
the cubic stone which is found in the middle of the sea. under which
dwells a mystic character whose guises van.&rsquo; from a miraculous fish,
even a whale, to a “green fire.&rsquo;&rsquo; the &ldquo;king of all fires.&rdquo; the &ldquo;central
fire.&rdquo; to the Devil himself. The chief source for him are Russian 2 '
and Finnish magic formulae, and these &ldquo;superstitions&rdquo; (&ldquo;left-overs”)
are Stone Age fragments of flinty hardness embedded in the softer
structure of historic overlay. Magic material withstands change,
just because of its resistance to the erosion of common sense. As far
as these magic formulae go. they became embedded in a Christian
context as the particular populations underwent conversion, but
they remain as witnesses for a very different understanding of the
cosmos. For example. Finnish runes on the origin of water state that
&ldquo;all rivers come from the Jordan, into which all rivers flow. &quot; that
&ldquo;water has its origin in the eddy of the holy river—it is the bathing
water of Jesus, the tears of God.&rdquo; 2 ’ On the other hand. Scandina¬
vian formulae stress the point that Christ &ldquo;stopped up the Jordan&rdquo;
or &ldquo;the Sea of Noah&rdquo; ( Mansikka. pp. a-iqf.. 29-. n. 1) which, in its
rum. fits into the P.istor of Hennas, where Christ is compared to a
&ldquo;cube-shaped mountain&rdquo; (see above, p. ::i). From this it is not</p>

<p>strange that the Cross becomes the “new tree,” marking new cross¬
roads. One need not go as far as Russia for that. In the famous
frescoes of Piero della Francesca in Arezzo there is “the discovery
of the True Cross.” It begins with the death of Adam, lying at the
foot of the tree. The wood from the tree will later provide the
material for the Cross. Later still, St. Helena, mother of Constan¬
tine, sees it in a dream and causes the wood to be dug up to become
the holiest of relics. Piero illustrated nothing that was not in good
medieval tradition. This is, one might say, sensitive ground.</p>
