<p>ils we* were moving toward the conclusion of this essay, some
chance or accident or kind intention brought to our eyes, after
many years, the work of an author who was our guide when we
tried for a first understanding of the early consciousness of man. It
was Cassirer’s opus on mythical thought. And with all the respect
one owes the great historian of Renaissance philosophy, we were
astounded. We went through the persuasive and limpid prose,
tracing the gradual growth of the concept from wild and uncouth
beginnings to the height of Kantian awareness. We gazed again at
the stately cortege of great scholars and researchers, Humboldt,
Max Muller, Usener and Wissowa, Frazer and Cumont and so many
others, the imposing phalanx in which philology, ethnology, his¬
tory of religion, archaeology, and not least philosophy, display their</p>

<p>327 * The Lost Treasure</p>
<p>well-knit progress in good order, to be finally sifted and cleared
up by the modern historian of culture. And then, as we reflected
further that here was the material that was going to provide ad¬
vanced survey courses in the immense universities of the future, to
build the gleaming machinery of electronic-printed and audiovisual
General Humanities for the Masses, we were suddenly overcome
with the haunting memory of that unwearied, dedicated, and ridicu¬
lous pair, Bouvard and Pecuchet. The merciless irony of Flaubert
was surely not called for in the case of Cassirer, but the same genius
who created Madame Bovary was suddenly showing us again the
shape of certain things to come. A noble enterprise was due to fail,
worse, was slated already for the coming Dictionnaire des Idees
Regues. What Flaubert’s pathetic little self-taught characters had
in common with the sovereign cultural historian was clear: it was
intellectual pride, judging from the height of Progress, which tele¬
scopes the countless centuries of the archaic past into artless primi¬
tive prattle, to be understood by analogy with the surviving “primi¬
tives” around us. Too much of that primitiveness lies in the eye of
the beholder. It took the uncanny penetration of trained observers
like Griaule to uncover suddenly the universe of thought which
remained hidden to generations of modern Africanists.</p>
<p>The great merit of Ernst Cassirer lies in his tracing the existence
of “symbolic forms” from the past in the midst of historic culture.
Who but he should have been able to discern the lineaments of
archaic myth? Yet he remained blinded by condescension. Evolu¬
tion, a brilliant biological idea of our own past, construed into a
universal banality, held him in thrall. He could not follow up his
insight because of the fatal confusion which has established itself
between biological time, the time of evolution, and the time of man¬
kind. The time of man, in which he has lived the life of the mind,
goes back into the tens of millennia, but it is not the same as biologi¬
cal time. Again and again, in our text, we have adverted to this con¬
fusion which has hardened to become worse confounded. If Cas¬
sirer’s idea of mythical thought is already dated, as are his sources,
one must expect the survey courses of the future to go farther in</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 328</p>
<p>the same direction with sociological psychology and anthropologi¬
cal sociology, until all traces of the past have been wiped out. The
masses will then have a culture of commonplaces reared on the com¬
mon ideas of the last two centuries of history. Even the gifts of a
Cassirer, who could discern the links between language and thought
in modern science, left him defenseless when he accepted the most
jejune reports of missionaries, and the most naive intuitions of the
obvious from the specialists of his own time. This makes his work
“passe.” Those are the wages of the sin of intellectual pride. In the
very process of establishing an identity between non-discursive
symbolism and “primitiveness,” he cut himself off from the Kantian
synthesis.</p>
<p>Where are the snows of yesteryear? In the very beginning of
Myth and Language, a curious equivocation, quite unintentional,
moves in with the words of Plato from the Phaedrns , a pleasant rail¬
lery at the intellectual exercises of the oversubtle with myth and
“mythologemes.” Clearly Professor Cassirer intends to take the
reader into camp, and remind him with the authority of the Master
that sober thought is in order, even concerning this “rustic science.”
Does he expect one to forget about the Tinmens? For in this, among
his last Dialogues, Plato deals gravely and solemnly with first and
last things, with the universe and the fate of the soul. And yet the
Tinmens is, openly, explicitly, one great myth and nothing else. Is
it then “unserious,” as Plato perversely would like to have certain
scholars believe? They have walked into the trap. For Plato not
only has put into his piece all the science he can obtain, he has
entrusted to it reserved knowledge of grave import, received from
his archaic ancestors, and he soberly adjures the reader not to be
too serious about it, nor even cultural in the modern sense, but to
understand it, if he can. The scholar is already in a hopeless tangle,
and Lord help him.</p>
<p>A simple way out would be to admit that myth is neither irre¬
sponsible fantasy, nor the object of weighty psychology, or any
such thing. It is “wholly other,” and requires to be looked at with
open eyes. This is what we have tried to do.</p>

<p>Wandelt sich schncll auch die Welt
Wie Wolkengestalten,</p>
<p>Alles Vollendete fiillt
Heim zum Uralten.*</p>
<p>R. M. Rilke, Sonettc an Orpheus</p>
<p>In order to find bearings, one can go back for a moment to the
thought of two fundamental moderns: Tolstoy, the last great epic
writer, and Simone Weil, the last great saint of Christendom, even
if a Gnostic one. Tolstoy, in his later years, was tormented with
the question whether a way could be found to make some sense
out of the events of history as he knew them. He concluded despair¬
ingly that sense there is none, that whatever the justifications of
philosophers, the so-called makers of history are the puppets of fate.
The reality of war destroyed all semblance of rationality, and left
only a dreadful confusion. The modern consciousness is brought
to face the stark events, from which one can draw only pragmatic
inferences, starting from what is ascertained as the fait accompli .</p>
<p>And here, maybe, we find ourselves facing one of the Tolstoyan
paradoxes driven to a point well-nigh unbearable. In his memorable
and desperate letter of 1908 to Gandhi, then an obscure lawyer,
which started the latter on his way to the teaching of nonviolence,
satyagraha, Tolstoy denounces the various forms of violence, mur¬
der, and fraud on which society is based, which perpetuate educa¬
tion and class distinctions as a whole. In it he included all the official
religions.</p>
<p>And then he pointed to science as the arch-culprit, because it
teaches man to do violence to himself and to nature essentially. Of
course, Tolstoy is thinking of the arrogant spirit of scientism with
its heartless, un-understanding doctrines. It would never have oc-</p>

</ul>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 330</p>
<p>curred to him that science is really something else, with its spirit
of pure research and serene dispassionateness. We would say now
that technology is the culprit. But the finger is pointed unequivo¬
cally at our modern and vulgarizing idea of “science for the masses”
and the consumer society. Against that, Tolstoy holds the one
thing, Christian love—pure and simple—as wholly spontaneous,
natural, and compelling. We might say, keeping away from Tolstoy
and his illuminations, that what he asserts is respect for life and
spontaneity, a holy restraint for the arcane ways of the cosmos
itself, embodied in the community of beings with a conscience. Fie
forgot perhaps, also, his own striving for harmony, which makes
of him, in War and Peace, the legitimate successor of the great
K’wei, that singular “Master of Music” in the new Empire of Let¬
ters. A reserved knowledge, that too, and far from our cliche of the
“common man,” for Christ addressed himself to “those who have
ears to hear.”</p>
<p>Simone Weil, lost in the turmoil of the Second World War,
thought she saw a retrospective answer in the Greeks, in Homer
himself, who had been called the Teacher of Greece. She called
the Iliad the “Poem of Force” because it showed Force at the center
of human history, a powerful and clear mirror of man’s condition
—with no soothing nonsense added. Death for the vanquished,
nemesis for the conqueror—these are two members of the equation.
The strictly geometrical atonement that comes with the abuse of
force was the principal theme of Greek thought. It persisted
wherever Greek thought had reached. And yet, Western man, the
heir of the Judeo-Christian tradition, has lost it—so utterly that
in no Western language is there a word to express it. The notions
of limit, of measure, of commensurability, which guided the thought
of sages have survived only in Greek science and in the catharsis
of tragedy. This seemed to draw the boundary of understanding.
It is a strange truth, notes Simone Weil, that men today should be
geometers only with respect to matter. But Plato’s famous lost lec¬
ture on the Good is known to have been based on geometrical
demonstration. It had been so from the beginning in Greece. Not
only Anaximander’s ethical statics of the cosmos, but the whole</p>
<p>^ ^ T</p>
<p>The Lost Treasure</p>
<p>Pythagorean theory had been based on those three mathematical
sciences: number, music, astronomy. Here lay the undeviating heart
of truth on which the Good can rest, and the rest concerned engi¬
neers. Even in Thucydides, there is a kind of reductio ad absurdum .
And it shows that if the Greeks were no less miserable than we are
in life, still the great epic idea remains: no hate for the enemy, no
contempt for the victim. The measures of the cosmos unfolded the
facts. Force, Necessity, must be conceived as within an order. The
crucial word remains that of the Timaeus: ‘‘Reason overruled Ne¬
cessity by persuading her to guide the greatest part of the things
that become towards what is best&quot; (48A). There is a great idea
here. This is how far the mind could read, and yet be able to make
sense of reality. This is what the Greeks had accepted as the bound¬
ary of thought. However original their minds, one might say that
the inheritance of archaic Measures had built up their patrimony,
indestructibly.</p>
<p>Man has moved beyond that, and has brought the marvelous
power of mathematics to the conquest of matter, as deep down as
the core of the atom, as far out as the outer-galactic nebulae. But
it is just as Simone Weil remarked, men are geometers only with
respect to matter and energy. The rest one has to leave to events,
and probabilities, to the physics of the dust. Man remains staring
at what in his own frame is the denial of thought, the fait accompli.
One dares not even examine the consequences of this geometry;
men feel their way apprehensively around such fate-laden corol¬
laries as “information&quot; or “overkill/* They turn under one&rsquo;s eyes
into faits accomplis. The historical view of the past does not lend
itself to contemplation. But as man tries by means of contrast to
build up his experience of the true, he finds that truth is at odds
with his ancient faith in continuity. Scientific prediction moves
away from “instant catastrophes,&quot; on the subatomic level, breaks
against the perpetual resurgence of falsifiability. Whatever is au¬
thentic expression in art, cleansed of context, scatters into the un¬
ceasing variety of styles, of responses, of happenings and discov¬
eries; not even the specious present, but the fractured instant is for
us the Now of Time.</p>

<p>III</p>
<p>History is a nightmare from
which I am trying to awake.</p>
<p>James Joyce, Ulysses</p>
<p>In contrast with the present world, the archaic past has much to
speak for it. It was based on a very high culture, an artistic one of
a high order as everyone knows, and on a scientific culture too. It
brought the first technological Revolution, on which so-called an¬
tiquity was to rest for millennia. Yet it lived on and flowered and
let the world live. People like to ignore this archaic science because
it started from the wrong foundations and drew any number of
wrong conclusions, yet historians know that wrongness is not a test
for relevance, that a course of reasoning may be scientifically im¬
portant independent of its endpoints. Our forebears built up their
world view from the idea which today would be called geocentric;
they concluded with speculations about the fate of man’s soul in a
cosmos in which present geography and the science of heaven are
still woven together. Worse, maybe, they built them up on a con¬
ception of time which is utterly different from the modern metric,
linear, monotone conception of time. Their universe could have
nothing to do with ours, derived as it was from the apparent revolu¬
tions of the stars, from pure kinematics. It has taken a great in¬
tellectual effort on the part of many great scholars to transfer
themselves back to that perspective. The results have been aston¬
ishingly fruitful. For those forebears did not only build up time
into a structure, cyclic time: along with it came their creative idea of
Number as the secret of things. When they said “things are num¬
bers,” they swept in an immense arc over the whole field of ideas,
astronomical and mathematical, from which real science was going
to be born. Those unknown geniuses set modern thought on its
way, foreshortened its evolution. But their ideas were at least as
complicated as our own have come to be.</p>
<p>Cosmological Time, the “dance of stars” as Plato called it, was
not a mere angular measure, an empty container, as it has now be¬
come, the container of so-called history; that is, of frightful and</p>
<p>The Lost Treasure</p>
<p>^ ^</p>
<p>:&gt; y i</p>
<p>meaningless surprises that people have resigned themselves to calling
the fait accompli. It was felt to be potent enough to control events
inflexibly, as it molded them to its sequences in a cosmic manifold
in which past and future called to each other, deep calling to deep.
The awesome Measure repeated and echoed the structure in many
ways, gave Time the scansion, the inexorable decisions through
which an instant “fell due/’</p>
<p>Those interlocking Measures were endowed with such a tran¬
scendent dignity as to give a foundation to reality that all of mod¬
ern physics cannot achieve; for. unlike physics, they conveyed the
first idea of “what it is to be,&quot; and what they focused on became
by contrast almost a blend of past and future, so that Time tended
to be essentially oracular. It presented, it announced, as it were; it
oriented men for the event as the Chorus was later to do in a Greek
tragedy. Whatever idea man could form of himself, the consecrated
event unfolding itself before him protected him from being the
“dream of a shadow.&quot;</p>
<p>Again and again, in the course of this essay, we have insisted on
the vanity of any attempt to give an “image&quot; of the archaic cosmos,
even were it such an image as Rembrandt drew of the cabalistic
apparition to the Initiate, or as Faust suddenly saw in the sign of
the Spirit of Earth. Even as a magic scheme, it would have to be a
design of insoluble complexity. Far worse did our own scholarly
predecessors fare when they tried for a model, conceived mechan¬
ically. an orrery, a planetarium maybe, such as Plato suggests teas-
ingly in his deadpan way with his whorls and spindles and frames
and pillars. A real model might indeed help, he goes on without
batting an eye. and one realizes it would come into the price range
of a Zeiss Planetarium, still true to the kinematic rigor of the Powers
of heaven, but blind to their moving soul in its action—and Plato&rsquo;s
machinery promptly dissolves into contradictions, no real “model&quot;
at all. Plato will never yield on his “unseriousness.&quot; which for him
is a matter of principle, a way of leaving mystery alone while re¬
specting reason as far as it can go. Another image suggested by the
past, still older than planetary models, would be the “tissue&quot; woven
in the skies, the Powers working at the whirring loom of Time, says
Goethe, as thev weave the living mantle of the Deitv. But as in all</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 334</p>
<p>those images, the real terms are life and harmony, many harmonics,
such as Pythagoreans went on forever investigating. Our own “re¬
construction,” whatever it is, would come as close to a harmony as
our cat achieves by stretching out full length on a keyboard. Kep¬
ler’s mad attempt at writing out the notes of the “Harmony of the
Spheres” was bound to fail abysmally to express the true lawful¬
ness: what Plato called the Song of Lachesis.</p>
<p>Men have learned to respect it without thinking. Even today, as
one celebrates Christmas, one invokes the unique gift of that cyclic
time—the gift of not being historical; its opening into the timeless,
the virtue of mapping the whole of itself into a vital present, laden
with ancestral voices, oracles, and rites from the past. With what
sincerity is left to them, men invoke the remission of ancient sins,
the rebirth of the Soul even as was done many millennia ago. Peo¬
ple beg from that Time the renewed strength to carry on against a
senseless reality—and still ask their children to aid their unbelief.</p>
<p>True history goes by myths. Its forces are mythical. As Voltaire
remarked coolly, it is a matter of which myth you choose.</p>
<p>The name of Revolutions is a true technical term of astronomic
knowledge and myth: that which ever returns to the same point.
It became insistently identified with the idea of the Great Change.
As soon as men began to misunderstand it, it set History on the
march with irreversible changes. But in the Middle Ages it still
promised a return to the undefined Origins, to the Golden Age,
when Adam delved and Eve span, or, more Christianly, to when
the Lord still walked on earth. Joachim of Flora (c. 1200) was still
the prophet of the Great Change that was to be a true accomplish¬
ment of ancient prophecies. After the ages of the Father and the
Son men expected the Age of the Holy Ghost to follow imme¬
diately, when all men would be brothers—a great revolutionary
moment sparked by the order of St. Francis. It lived on in the
shrunken horizon of Enlightenment, which set the span back to the
Greeks and Romans as semi-gods. And yet, in those classical times,
that dream was already there. It was of a return far back to the
birth of a Miraculous Child. And back far beyond that, to the
clearer idea of cosmic configurations such as they were when time
had not yet been set in motion. Here came the Timaeus.</p>
<p>3 a a</p>
<p>The Lost Treasure</p>
<p>The idea lingered on. In the Apocalypses and Cosmogonies, in
the Yedic poems, rime is scrambled artificially and deliberately into
elements, lunar stations, or proto-chess, to restore the vision, the
prophetic or sibylline vision. Out of this thoughtful scrambling of
elements came the Alphabet. A prodigious conquest, like the mak¬
ing of iron, and a grievous gift unto men. as Hesiod might say.
There is no doubt that one is dealing with the creations of genius,
even if they were dashes in the darkness, which had found a way
to perpetuate and propagate themselves.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that the actual chronicle of the archaic ages
is full of “barbaric” events. What such migrations as those of the
Cimmerians, of the Mongols, of the Peoples of the Sea achieved
in the way of destruction and dispersal is beyond our imagination.
One calls this the primitive way of life, and blithely conjectures
extermination in the biological sense, forgetting what biology has
to say of real conflicts among animal tribes. It is only man. more
especially modern man. who knows the art of total kill, the quick
and the slow. But archaic cultures, devoid of history but steeped
in myth, did not And in events the surprise of the fait accompli,
stunning and shattering to the mind in the way Auschwitz is to us.
Mythical experience has its own ways of meeting catastrophe. Men
were able to see things nobly. Narration became epic.</p>
<p>The great epic of the Fall of the Xibelungen mirrors in its own
way the invasion of Attila and his Huns, the “Scourge of God.”
Official history might counter the Mongol hordes with the Roman
victory on the Catalaunic fields, but the Attila of legend, chief of
Gog and Magog, remains more imposing, even as he passes silently
out of the scene, than Jenghiz or Tamerlane with their historic
conquests and pyramids of skulls. He has little to act. he is the
typical emperor of myth. Like Theodoric. like Arthur, like Kai
Khusrau. he is the unmoved chess king around whom figures move.
The Xibelungen story shows how mythical thought dealt with the
crisis. It is Nemesis who destroys the German warriors at the last.
Attila. “king Etzel.” suffers in his turn, without losing the authority
of the conqueror. His child dies at the hands of Hagen, last of the
sinful brood who is cut down as a captive by the infuriated mother,
destroyed in turn by Hildebrand, reconciled to the conqueror, who</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 336</p>
<p>brings the drama to a catharsis. Attila the I Iun and Theodoric the
Goth, joined in the tale as allies, are left to weep together the death
of great heroes. No hatred, no terror left, except at the working of
Fate.</p>
<p>From the last night of Troy, extinguished in slaughter, what re¬
mains in living myth is the flight of the few survivors toward new
shores. There they become mythical founding heroes in their turn,
contended for by the great cities of the West. This is how myth
deals with its own, and Nemesis is felt at last to catch up with the
Roman Empire. The spirit of Homer’s epic impassiveness led the
ancient mind all the way up to the end of the classic world, purged
of resentment and hatred, but nowhere more impressively than in
Virgil’s soul-stricken invocation, a vision of doom at a time when
Rome fancied itself established forever: “Please, gods, have mercy.
Have we not atoned enough for the original perjury of Troy?”
lain satis luivms Laomedonteae periuria Troiae . . . But there is no
atonement in full measure within the unceasing rhythm of cycles
and megacycles, which builds up a living dialectic of mythical
imagination. The conquests and subversions which reshaped the
world with Alexander were surely more important than any feats
attributed to the legendary king of Uruk; but the latter’s other¬
worldly sheen reverberated on the Macedonian, and tradition
forced him into the pattern of another Gilgamesh, still bent on the
discovery and conquest of all earth, water, and air, down to the
end of the world and beyond, still questing in vain after immortal
life. The molding capacity of established myth created the historic
episodes that he needed to fit himself into the role, went beyond
him to build up the “two-horned” demigod, Dhul-Karnein, he who
erected a brazen wall against the path of destruction from the East,
the peril of Gog and Magog, a fable that even the later glory of
the Roman Empire could not imitate. For that kind of time always
tends to move off into the forms of timelessness.</p>
<p>Let us go back to the end of the wonderful adventure of Dante’s
Odysseus, as he moves out of the straits of Gibraltar:</p>
<p>And having turned our poop towards the morning ,</p>
<p>Our oars we turned to wings in crazy flight</p>
<p>Always gaining to the left-hand side.</p>
<p>337 * The Lost Treasure</p>
<p>That is, he has “turned his poop to the east,” and his prow directly
west; he proceeds “always gaining to the left-hand side.” In other
words, it looks as if he were trying to circumnavigate Africa, not
as Columbus but as Vasco da Gama did, going to India. The gen¬
eral direction of his “crazy flight” is actually south, across the
equator and then the Tropic of Capricorn, just as he has already
done in Homer under Circe’s sailing directions: “follow the wind
from the North.” He is still looking for the “experience, beyond
the sun, of the world without people.” But in Dante’s world scheme,
he is clearly making for the Antipodes, which means, vaguely, the
unknown South Seas.</p>
<p>And, in fact , all the stars of the other pole had come into sight ,
and those of onrs had sunk so low that they did not rise from the sea;
five times the light of the moon had waxed and waned , when we
described a tall mountain, dim from the distance , so tall that I
had never seen any. We rejoiced , and soon it turned to tears . . .</p>
<p>for it was, as we already know (see chapter XIV, “The Whirl¬
pool”), the mount of Purgatory, denied to the living. Hence, Provi¬
dence decreed a whirl that swallowed the ship and all its hands,
and that was the end.</p>
<p>What was Columbus’ discovery? Hardly more.</p>
<p>Dante’s description was not really an invention; it was derived
from texts of his own time, and we find it, bodily transcribed, in
Columbus’ own extracts and notes, made in the years of waiting
in Spain, from his favorite readings: “subtle shining secrecies, writ
in the glossy margent of such bookes .” 1 It is still the land of Eden.</p>
<p>A long distance by land and sea from our habitable land; it is so high
that it touches the lower sphere, and the waters of the Flood never
touched it . . . . The waters which descend from this very high</p>
<p>mountain form an immense lake. The fall of such waters makes such
a noise that the inhabitants are born deaf. From that lake as the one
source flow the four rivers of Paradise: Physon w hich is the Ganges,
Gyon w hich is the Nile, Tigris and Euphrates &hellip;. A fountain there
is in Paradise w T hich waters the garden of delights and which is dif¬
fused in the four rivers. According to Isidore, John of Damascus,
Bede, Strabo and Peter Comestor . . . Pliny and Solinus, Alarinus of</p>
<p>1 Shakespeare, The Rape of Lucrece.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 338</p>
<p>Tyre’s corrections of Ptolemy show that the sea can be crossed with
favorable winds in a few days, going down per deorsum Africae,
along the back of Africa . . . for the earth extends from Spain to the
Indies more than 180°. And the proof is that Ezra savs that 6/7ths of
the globe are land, Ambrosius and Augustine holding Ezra for a
prophet . . . the degree being equal to 52 2/3 Roman Miles &hellip;.</p>
<p>The sources of Columbus are well known, one of them being
Pierre d’Ailly’s famous bn ago Miindi of the 14th century, and an¬
other Aeneas Sylvius’ Historia Rerum ubicinnque gestarum of the
15th. Pierre d’Ailly differs even more from Ptolemy by ruining his
celestial coordinates, whereas Aeneas Sylvius is no more than a
compilation, a vague miroir historia! , and yet these are the books in
which Columbus put his trust, much more than in his maps, and
rightly so. Even Toscanelli’s famous letter to Martius does no more
than emphasize Marco Polo’s Cipango (Japan) and set it a thousand
miles east; which at least encouraged the lonely Genoese, who to
the end never suspected the existence of the Pacific, and made him
look for the golden homes of Cipango while he was discovering
Cuba. His never-never land, his own Island of St. Brandaen, must
have been in his mind somewhere between the Canaries and the
Empire of Prester John, along “the back of Africa,” and this was
enough impetus for him to discover America, or rather invent it
out of his mythical enthusiasm, still bent on the Garden of Eden
and its nightingales. As for Toscanelli, the “cosmographer,” his
impulse lay not so much in his geographical expertise on China as
in his vaticination of a new world-age. Columbus’ and Toscanelli’s
clear and very modern intention was “to search for the East by
way of the West”; but what did it amount to? One of the authori¬
ties assured that Aryim, umbilicus maris , wherever it may be, was
not “in the middle of the habitable earth,” but further, 90° off.
Another said that the distance between Spain and the eastern edge
of India was “not much.” Once out in the Atlantic, Columbus had
to rely on his faith in timeless myth, from Gilgamesh to Alexander.
To be sure, he had the compass, but his cosmography had lost the
very idea of the heavens; and, like his Odyssean and medieval fore¬
bears, he had to keep searching for the Islands of the Blessed.</p>
<p>It may be we shall find the Happy Isles,</p>
<p>and meet the great Achilles , whom we knew . . .</p>
<p>339 ’ The Lost T re asm e</p>
<p>What led him to his discovery was his wonderful skill as a navi¬
gator, which allowed him to ride out equinoctial storms and never
lose a ship as he threaded his caravels through the tricky channels of
the Indies. America was the reward for Paolo Toscanelli’s 2 and
Christopher Columbus’ Archaic faith.</p>
<p>The relation of myth to history is very important indeed, but
the influence of one on the other often goes counter to the inter¬
pretations of most debunkers. The famed nightingale from Eden
that Columbus wrote he heard when he landed on Wading Island
is only one striking counterexample. But there are more. For in¬
stance, myth had influence on the geopolitics of great Eastern con¬
querors like Tamerlane and Mohammed II. These two men of
action, and decisive action, were far from illiterate. They had the
cultures of two languages at their disposal, Turkish and Persian, and
their inquisitive minds liked to dwell on great plans of adventure
toward the West. Yet although they were obsessed with the destruc¬
tion of the Empire of Rum (Rome), it has been shown (von
Hammer) that they had never so much as heard of Caesar and his
great successors. Their historical information did not go beyond the
“Romaunt of Alexander” in the Persian version. One is back again
with Gilgamesh as the prime source. The comparison is all in their
favor. While the potentates of Europe were loosing themselves in
miserable quarrels, frittering away their possibilities, and even seek¬
ing an alliance with the Turk, only Pope Aeneas Sylvius, sick and
dying, was finding the words for the occasion: “The barbarians
have murdered the successor of Constantine together with his peo¬
ple, desecrated the temples of the Lord, overthrown the altars,
thrown to the swine the relics of the martyrs, killed the priests,
ravished their women and daughters, even the virgins consecrated
to God; they have dragged along the camp the image of our cruci¬
fied Savior, to the cry of ‘there goes the God of the Christians’ and
have defiled it with filth and spit—and we seem to care for nothing.”
It was indeed the final tragedy of Christendom, vanishing first
West, then East. At that point only the conquering Sultan found
the words for the occasion. “The ruler of the world”—writes</p>
<p>2 Giorgio de Santillana, “Paolo Toscanelli and His Friends,” in Reflections on
Men and Ideas (1968), pp. 33-47.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 340</p>
<p>Tursum Beg, his chronicler—moved up like a spirit, to the summit
of Saint Sophia; he watched signs of the already coming decay, and
formed elegiac thoughts: “The spider serves as watchman in the
porticoes of the cupola of Khusrau. The owl sounds the last post
in the palace of Afrasiyab. Such is the world, and it is doomed to
come to an end.”</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>What time span did the archaic world embrace within our own
frame? Its beginning has already been placed in the Neolithic, with¬
out setting limits in the past; let prehistoric archaeologists decide.
The astronomical system seems to conceive of the Golden Age, the
Saturnian Era, as already mythical, in the proper sense. One can
then say that it took shape about 4000 b.c ., 3 that it lasted into proto¬
history and beyond. 4 The fearful loss of substance that tradition
suffered in the Greek Middle Ages (the same happened in Egypt
too, before the Middle Kingdom) has created an almost complete
gap with what we call Classical Antiquity, but enough did remain to
ensure a continuity with those ancestors whom Plato and Aristotle
liked to call “the men close to the Gods” and who were thought
of in this way even to our Renaissance. In Plato’s philosophy, Ar¬
chaic Time stayed intact; it was resolutely understood as “wholly
other” from extension, wholly incompatible with what Parmenides
had already grasped in his Revelation, with what Democritus coldly
theorized. But archaic time is the universe, like it circular and defi¬
nite. It is the essence of definition, and so it continues to be through¬
out Classical Antiquity, which did not believe in progress but in
eternal returns. In that world it was Space which, if taken by itself,
brought in indefiniteness and incoherence. Ultimately, in Plato,
space was identified with the nature of Non-Being. Plato called
space the “Receptacle.” This idea, so puzzling for us who think in
spatial terms and cut up reality, as Bergson said, along dotted lines
drawn in space, must have been for Plato an easy and natural con¬
clusion. He had inherited the idea that reality, or rather Being, was</p>
<p>3 See W. Hartner, “The Earliest History of the Constellations in the Near East
and the Motif of the Lion-Bull Combat,” JNES 24 (1965), pp. 1-16, 16 plates.</p>
<p>4 But we do not know. These people could compute backward as well as forward.</p>
<p>34 i • The Lost Treasure</p>
<p>defined in terms of Time above all. It was Space which brought in
confusion, multiplicity, the resistance to Order, what Plato called
the Unruly and Irregular which always resist the mind. In the
beginning, it would seem, space even resisted the mind of the
Creating Demiurge, for it presented him with the original chaos,
a kind of foreign body intractably plemmelds kai atakteds, unorga¬
nized, devoid of any rhythm. Even the Demiurge must struggle to
force it into shape, within the limits of his power.</p>
<p>When did the archiac world come to an end? There are many
testimonials of the bewildering change. Plutarch, a true pagan, pon¬
dered about a.d. 60, why it was “that oracles had ceased to give
answers.” It is on this occasion that he told the tale of the voice
that came from the sea, telling the pilot that “the Great Pan was
dead.” Recounting it on a previous occasion (above, chapter XX,
p. 277), it was noted that the experts of the Emperor Tiberius de¬
cided that it must be Pan no. 3. Another world-age must be passing,
together with the gods who belonged to it. For traditionalists it was
indeed one more sign of the passing of the Age of Aries and the ad¬
vent of the Age of Pisces. Historically, it is known as the advent of
the Christian revolution, marked in so many ways by the sign of the
Fish. It may have taken place with the Edict of Theodosius in
a.d. 390. It was to be a change so profound that it would have caused
Plutarch to lose his bearings. It was the end of the Parcae, the god¬
desses who lived Fate. The Song of Lachesis had been silenced. In
a few centuries, it was as if new stars were shining over the heads of
men brought up in a classical culture. The introduction of new
gods from the East was certainly a contributory cause of the rapid
conversion of the Roman elite, which appeared to the Christians a
miracle in itself. Oracles and omens had been part of the texture of
circular Time, using the sibylline language which continuously
threw a rainbow bridge from the past into the future.</p>
<p>As later developments were to show, the great web of cyclical
time suffered irreparable harm from the doctrine of the Incarnation,
but did not snap asunder all at once. For a long time the belief in
the Second Coming among Christians kept time together. But as it
became established that the supramundane advent of Christ into the
world had cleft time into an absolute Before and After, that it was</p>
<p>Hamlet’s Mill • 342</p>
<p>a unique event not subject to repetition, then duration became
simple extension, a waiting for the day of judgment, increasingly
dependent on the vicissitudes of belief.</p>
<p>I tried to determine once, from the testimony of artistic experi¬
ence, the period when the time frame of reality came to be felt and
described in terms of three-dimensional space. 5 This first sign of the
Scientific Revolution, I suggested, coincided with the invention of
perspective in the 15th century. It arrived, as it were, surrepti¬
tiously, originating in the minds of great artists and technologists
(artist being then the word for artisan). What is clear is that by
the end of the Renaissance time and space had become what we
mean by them.</p>
<p>Newton conceived of the frame of the universe as made up of
absolute space and time. The mode of thought became natural, and
not until Einstein did new and greater difficulties arise to resist the
imagination. Today one should begin to appreciate the divine sim¬
plicity of the archaic frame, which took time as the one frame, even
at the terrible price of making the cosmos itself into the “bubble
universe.” It was a decisive option. The choice went deep to the
roots of man’s being. It conditioned Aristotelian theory and condi¬
tioned Christian imagination. It constrained even Copernicus and
Kepler. They both recoiled from unboundedness. That is why
one sees Aristarchus, Bruno and Galileo not simply as bold gen-
eralizers or investigators of regularities, but as souls of superhuman
audacity.</p>
<p>Aristarchus remained a loner, neglected in his time even by the
sovereign mind of Archimedes. Twenty centuries later, Bruno was
less a thinker than an inspired prophet of God’s infiniteness, identi¬
cal with the Universe itself. Galileo, the true scientist, still remained
sufficiently dominated by the circularity he needed in his cosmos so
that he did not dare to formulate the principle of rectilinear inertia
which was already present to his mind. He held passionately to the
circular cosmos. The circle was to him a metaphor of Being that
he was still willing to accept even at the price of unacceptable epi-</p>

tions on Men and Ideas (1968), pp. 137-66.</p>

<p>cycles. However much he supported perfect circularity by sober
and prosaic reasons, it remained to him first and last a “symbolic
form,” much as the Seven-ringed cup of Jamshyd, the magic Cal¬
dron of Koridwen, as the Cromlech of Stonehenge. The Untuning
of the World, the dissolution of the Cosmos, was to come only with
Descartes.</p>
<p>It was said earlier concerning the Mayan astronomers that the
connections were what counted. In the archaic universe all things
were signs and signatures of each other, inscribed in the hologram,
to be divined subtly. This was also the philosophy of the Pytha¬
goreans, and it presides over all of classical language, as distinct
from contemporary language. This was pointed out perceptively by
a modern critic, Roland Barthes, in Le degre zero de PEcriture.
“The economy of classical language,” he says, “is rational, which
means that in it words are abstracted as much as possible in the
interest of relationship . . . No word has a density by itself, it is
hardly the sign of a thing, but rather the means of conveying a
connection.” Today, the object of a modern poem is not to define
or qualify relations already conventionally agreed; one feels trans¬
ported, as it were, from the world of classical Newtonian physics
to the random world of subatomic particles, ruled by probabilistic
theory. The beginning of this was felt in Cezanne, in Rimbaud and
Mallarme. It is “an explosion of words” and forms, liberated words,
independent objects—discontinuous and magical, not controlled,
not organized by a sequence of “neutral signs.” The interrupted
flow of the new poetic language, Barthes remarks, “initiates a dis¬
continuous Nature, which is revealed only piecemeal.” Nature be¬
comes “a fragmented space, made of objects solitary and terrible,
because the links between them are only potential.” More, they are
arbitrary. They are supposed to be of the nature of the ancient
portentum. The only meaning to be drawn from those links is that
they are congenial to the mind that made them. The mind has
abdicated, or it shrinks in apocalyptic terror. In the arts we hear of
Amorphism, or “disintegration of form,” of the “triumph of inco¬
herence” in concrete poetry and contemporary music. The new
syntheses, if any are still possible, are beyond the horizon.</p>
