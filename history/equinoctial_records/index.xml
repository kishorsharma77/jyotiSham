      <description> &amp;ldquo;One also wonders if the tale of Prajāpati being fitted with a goat’s head after his beheading by Rudra’s agent Vīrabhadra alludes to this period, with the goat’s had representing Aries.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;अश्विनौ व्यात्तम्&amp;rdquo; इत्यस्मिन् उपर्युक्तम्। Roughly corresponds to Spica/Citra (नक्षत्रम्, न तु तारा) at polar longitude 180°, and pushya at around 102 deg. Thence, is close to Lahiri ayanAmsha as of 2000-s.  </description>

      <description>bce-0600-01-14 ashvinau svAti equinox tiShya shroNA solstice   garga-saṁhitā Garga, an astronomer whose name is found in the Mahabharata, where he is described as having an astronomical school at a place called Gargasrota in the Sarasvatī basin, is the reputed author of a pre-Siddhāntic calendaric treatise called Garga Saṁhita. He notes :
Yadā nivartatē &amp;lsquo;prāptaḥ śraviṣṭhām uttarāyaṇe
Aśleṣām dakśiṇo &amp;lsquo;prāptas tadā vindyān mahad bhayam.
Translation : When at the time of Ottarāyana the sun is found turning (north) without reaching the Sraviṣthās; and (at the time of Dakṣiṇāyana) turning (south) without reaching the Aśleṣā, it should be taken to indicate a period of calamity.</description>

      <description>This also corresponds to shrAvaNI pUrNimA being around summer solstice (~ the time of Apastamba gRhya sUtra-s, see ayanAMshachayanam page). &amp;ldquo;We have a text of the nagna nAstika-s, termed sUrya-praj~nApti, where the same system of calenderics as the VJ is expounded. But the jaina-s correct the winter solstice to shravaNa, suggesting that they were after the VJ in the period when you would actually expect the jaina-s to be around.</description>

      <description>bce-1400-01-13 bharaNi-3deg vishAkhA equinox dhaniShTha AshreShA-maghA solstice    &amp;ldquo;Dating by precession gives the date of the VJ as being around 1300 BC because the it states that the winter solistice was in the beginning for shraviShThA and summer in the mid-point of AshleShA. This is important because in the maitrAyaNi brAhmaNa, shAkhAyanya tells king bR^ihadratha that the winter solistice was in the middle of shraviShThA (MBU 6.</description>
