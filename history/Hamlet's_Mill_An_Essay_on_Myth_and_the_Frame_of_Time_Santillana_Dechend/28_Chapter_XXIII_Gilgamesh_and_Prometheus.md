Fire is. indeed, a key word, deserving a special inquiry. For the 
time being, however, it is not essential to understand everything 
about the different norms and measures, rules and regulations which 
have to be procured by gods or heroes who are destined to open 
“new ways." One can ignore here the true nature and identity of 
the various "treasures." whether they are called "oar" or “ferry 
man." or "hvama-melammu.” or "golden fleece." or “fire." This is 
not to say that all these terms are different names for the same 
thing, but that they identify several parts of the frame. 1 

It will be useful to recapitulate the ideas of the frame, as it has 
been traced through the Greek precedents. It started out. inno¬ 
cently enough, with the frame of a ship (see above, pp. 13of.), as the 
Greeks did. and finally ended up with the bewildering "world tree" 
called the skmtbha , which even Plato might have found intractable. 
In the end. it is nothing more than the structure of world colures, 
even if it rustles with many centuries of Hindu verbiage. 

1 Even a superficial study of the Chinese novel Feng Sben Yen I i.e„ Popular 
Account of the Promotion to Divinin') which, under the disguise of "historiogra¬ 
phy" dealing with the end of the Shang Dynasty and the beginning of the Chou, 
presents us with a fantastic description of a major crisis benveen world-ages, will 
reveal to the attentive reader the amount of “new deities"—responsible for old 
cosmic functions—who have to be appointed at a new Zero, beginning with 365 
gods, :8 new lunar mansions, etc.

Another point to bear in mind is the cosmological relevance of 
“way-openers” and “path-finders” like Gilgamesh. They are the 
ones who bring the manifold measures from that mysterious center, 
called Canopus or Eridu, or “the seat of Rita.” One can illustrate 
the general scheme by means of two adventures. 

The Argonauts, with the Golden Fleece on board, had to pass 
the Symplegades, the clashing rocks. Once a ship with its crew 
came through unharmed 2 —so the “blessed ones” ( makaroi) had 
decided long ago—the Symplegades would stay fixed, and be clash¬ 
ing rocks no longer. 3 After that “accepting the novel laws of the 
fixed earth,” they should “offer an easy passage to all ships, once 
they had learnt defeat.” 4 This is only one station on the long “open¬ 
ing travel” of the Argonauts transporting the Golden Fleece (of a 
ram), undertaken in all probability to introduce the Age of Aries, 5 
but it demonstrates best the relevant point, namely, “the novel 
laws.” 

Another instance—in fact, a crucial one—of an Opening of the 
Way comes to us from the Catlo’Itq in British Columbia. 6 We 
would call it a pocket encyclopedia of myth: 

A man had a daughter who possessed a wonderful bow and arrow, 
with which she was able to bring down everything she wanted. But 
she was lazy and was constantly sleeping. At this her father was angry 
and said: “Do not be always sleeping, but take thy bow and shoot at 
the navel of the ocean, so that we may get fire.” 

2 The Symplegades cut off, however, the ornament of the ship’s stern (aphla- 
stoio akra korymba), where the “soul” of the ship was understood to dwell. We 
do not know yet the precise meaning of this trait. Cf. H. Diels, “Das Aphlaston 
der antiken Schiffe,” in Z eitschrift des Vereins fiir Volkskunde (1915), pp. 61-80. 
It should be emphasized that, contrary to a widespread opinion, the planktai and 
the symplegades are not identical.

voyage of the demigods made them stand still in death.”

5 See the First Vatican Mythographer (c. 24, ed. Bode, vol. /, p. 9) stating 
about “Pelias vel Peleus” that he sent Jason to Colchis, “ut inde detulisset pellem 
auream, in qua Juppiter in caelum ascendit,” i.e., to fetch the Golden Fleece, in 
which Jupiter climbs the sky. See also A. B. Cook, “The European Sky-God,”

319 • Gilgamesh and Prometheus 


The navel of the ocean was a vast whirlpool in which sticks for mak¬ 
ing fire by friction were drifting about. At that time men were still 
without fire. Now the maiden seized her bow, shot into the navel of 
the ocean, and the material for fire-rubbing sprang ashore. 

Then the old man was glad. He kindled a large fire; and as he wanted 
to keep it to himself, he built a house with a door which snapped up 
and down like jaws and killed everybody that wanted to get in. But 
the people knew that he was in possession of the fire, and the stag 
determined to steal it for them. He took resinous wood, split it and 
stuck the splinters in his hair. Then he lashed two boats together, 
covered them with planks, danced and sang on them, and so he came 
to the old man’s house. He sang: “O, I go and will fetch the fire.” 
The old man’s daughter heard him singing, and said to her father: 
“O, let the stranger come into the house; he sings and dances so 
beautifully.” 

The stag landed and drew near the door, singing and dancing, and at 
the same time sprang to the door and made as if he wanted to enter 
the house. Then the door snapped to, without however touching him. 
But while it was again opening, he sprang quickly into the house. 
Here he seated himself at the fire, as if he wanted to dry himself, and 
continued singing. At the same time he let his head bend forward 
over the fire, so that he became quite sooty, and at last the splinters 
in his hair took fire. Then he sprang out, ran off and brought the fire 
to the people. 

Such is the story of Prometheus in Catlo’ltq. It is more than that. 
For the stag has stood for a long time for Kronos. In the Hindu 
tradition he is Yama who has been met before as Yama Agastya, 
and who, “following the course of the great rivers, discovered the 
way for many.” This stag is spread far and wide in the archaic 
world, with the same connotations. And he is the archaic Prome- 
theus-Kronos, “you who consume all and increase it again by the 
unlimited order of the Aion, wily-minded, you of crooked counsel, 
venerable Prometheus.” In Greek, semne Prometheu . It leaves no 
doubts. The Orphic invocation to Kronos, quoted in the very be¬ 
ginning on p. 12, defines him as “venerable” and couples him with 
the name of Kronos the Titan, and we did not go on to quote 
the awful name of Prometheus so as not to confuse the issue. To 
avoid confusing matters gratuitously, the name Prometheus has 
so far been used sparingly. It summons up a formidable implex. The

scholiast of Sophocles who gave the reference, quoting Polemon 
and Lysimachidcs who arc now lost sources, explains: “Prometheus 
was the first and the older who held in his right hand the scepter, 
but Hephaistos later and second.” 7 

These are the underground regions of Greek mythology, still 
barely noticed by the school of Frazer and Harrison in their search 
for prehistoric cults and symbols in the classical world. Yet here 
ancient Greek myth suddenly emerges in full light among Indian 
tribes in America, miraculously preserved. The very unnaturalness 
of the narrative shows how steps were telescoped or omitted 
through the ages. In one moment the Whirlpool emerges as the 
bearer of the fire-sticks of Pramantha and Tezcatlipoca. But why 
should they be in the whirl? Myth has its own shorthand logic to 
relate those floating fire-sticks to the cosmic whirl. And that logic 
goes on tying together the basic themes, the bow and the arrow of 
celestial kingship, the bow and arrow aimed at (or ending in) 
Sirius, Stella marls (compare appendix #2 on Orendel). 

The singing and dancing of the stag is intricately involved with a 
proto-Pythagorean theme. And the theme appears full-fledged in 
still another tale from the Northwest. The Son of Woodpecker, 
before shooting his bow, intoned a song, and as soon as he had 
found the right note, the flying arrows stuck in each other’s necks 
until they built the bridge of arrows to heaven; Sir James Frazer 
himself identified this theme with that of the scaling of Olympus in 
the Gigantomachy. But there is more. Although it is not stated 
explicitly that the “clashing doors” (the precessing equinoxes) of 
the old owner of fire ceased to clash, surely the stag opened a new 
passage by passing the door at the predestined right moment in his 
quest for the “fire.” 

There was little room for invention and variation in this solemn 
play with the great themes, although imagination did retain some 
freedom. Thus one might feel tempted to see pure imagination in 
the feckless laziness of the Old Adan’s Daughter. And yet, was it 
imagination, if one discovers in her the prototype of Ishtar, of 
whom it was said (see above, p. 215) that she “stirs up the apsu 
before Ea”? Lady-archers being a rare species, it is worth considera- 
7 Schol. Soph. O. C. 56 (Mayer, Giganten und Titanen , p. 95).

tion that the great Babylonian astronomical text, the so-called 
“Series mul APIN” (= Series Plough-Star, the Plough-Star being 
Triangulum), states: “the Bow-star is the Ishtar of Elam, daughter 
of Enlil.” There has been mention of the constellation of the Bow, 
built by stars of Argo and Canis Major, Sirius serving as “Arrow- 
Star” (see above, p. 216 and figure on p. 290). It is no less signifi¬ 
cant that the Egyptian divine archeress, Satit, aims her arrow at 
Sirius, as can be seen on the round Zodiac of Dendera. 

When one discovers a brief tale that miraculously encapsulates 
great myths in a few words, one is led to the suspicion that such 
tales are fragments of long and intricate recitals meant to hold their 
audience for hours; that, actually they represent something like 
“Apollodorus” or “Hyginus” who passed on the essential informa¬ 
tion in brief abstracts. But behind them stood a fully shaped and 
powerful literary tradition along with the Greek poets to give the 
ideas flesh and blood, whereas with an illiterate neolithic people 
such as the Catlo’ltq only the bare skeleton, even “Hygini Fabulae,” 
appears to have survived, unless we assume the informants withheld 
from the ethnologists the richer versions. (A colleague once told 
us about a Tibetan minstrel who, bidden to recite the saga of Bogda 
Gesser Khan, asked whether he should do the large version or the 
small one: the large would have taken weeks to recite properly.) 

It was stated earlier and should be re-stated here that “/zre” 'was 
thought of as a great circle reaching from one celestial pole to the 
other , and also that the fire sticks belong to the skambha (Atharva 
Veda 1 0.8.20), as an essential part of the frame. Among the things 
which helped us to recognize “/zre” as the equinoctial colure , only 
one fact needs mention here, that the Aztecs took Castor and Pollux 
(alpha beta Geminorum) for the first fire sticks, from which man¬ 
kind learned how to drill fire. This is known from Sahagun. 8 Con¬ 
sidering that the equinoctial colure of the Golden Age ran through 
Gemini (and Sagittarius), the fire sticks in Gemini offer a correct

Simeon, Dictionnaire de la Langne Nalmatl (1885) s.v. “mamalhuaztli: Les Ge- 
meaux, constellation,” who does not mention, though, that Sahagun identified 
mamalhuaztli with “astijellos,” fire sticks. Also, the Tasmanians felt indebted to 
Castor and Pollux for the first fire (see J. G. Frazer, Myths of the Origin of 
Fire [1930], pp. 3F).

rhyme to a verse in a Mongolian nuptial prayer which says: “Fire 
was born, when Heaven and Earth separated”; 9 in other words, 
before the falling apart of ecliptic and equator, there was no “fire,” 
the first being kindled in the Golden Age of the Twins. 

There is no certainty yet whether or not there are fixed rules, 
according to which one fire has to be fetched from the North, and 
the other from the South; both methods are employed. The Finns, 
for example, insist on the fire’s “cradle on the navel of the sky,” 
whence it rushes through seven or nine skies into the sea, to the 
bottom if it, in fact. 10 And Tezcatlipoca is claimed to be sitting at 
the celestial North Pole also, when drilling fire in the year 2-Reed, 
after the flood. Whereas it is said of the so-called fire-god of 
Mesopotamia: 

Gibil, the exalted hero whom Ea adorned with terrible brilliance 
f = melammu], who grew up in the pure apsu, who in Eridu, the place 
of (determining) fates, is unfailingly prepared, whose pure light 
reaches heaven—his bright tongue flashes like lightning; Gibil’s light 
flares up like the day. 11 

Gibil is also called, briefly, “hero, child of the Apsu.” If the “fire,” 
adorned with “terrible brilliance”—melammu/hvarna—is prepared 
in Eridu, one should be permitted to conclude that it has to be pro¬ 
cured from there, just as the Rigvedic Agni-Matarishvan, one 
among the Agnis, “fires,” had to be sought at the “confluence of 
the rivers” (appendix #38). 

But whether the “fire” comes from “above” or from “below,” 
the divine or semidivine (or two-thirds divine as Gilgamesh) beings 
who bring it from either topos could all be named after their com¬ 
mon function, as is done in Mexico, where Quetzalcouatl is also 
called “Ce acatl” = 1-Reed, 12 and Tezcatlipoca “Omacatl (Ome

12 Acatl/Reed represents, indeed, the arrow-stick, the drill stick of the fire drill 
and the “symbol of juridical power.” See E. Seler, Gesavnnelte Abhandlungen

acatl) = 2-Reed. In the same way we might call the corresponding 
heroes of the Old World “i-Narthex,” “2-Narthex,” and so forth, 
after the “reed,” in which the stolen fire was brought by the most 
famous Titan, Prometheus, a “portion” of Saturn. 

Without taking part in the heated discussion on the interpretation 
of the very name Gilgamesh— d GIS.GIN.MEZ/MAS, and other 
forms—one can mention that GIS means “wood, tree,” and MEZ/ 
MAS a particular kind of wood, 13 and that there are reasons for 
understanding our hero as a true Prometheus. 

Here it is worth turning briefly to a text recently translated anew 
and edited by P. Gossmann, the tablets of the Era-Epos. This is a 
grim poem, whose appalling fierceness emerges in almost every 
word, dedicated as it is to the god of Death, Era (also spelled Irra), 
a part of Nergal. The subject matter is wholly mythological, han¬ 
dling the end of a world in terms which would hardly disgrace the 
Edda, and dealing again with the Flood to end all floods in the 
gloomy spirit of Genesis. But here something shines out unmistak¬ 
ably that the commentators on Genesis have missed. They have 
missed it so completely that even in our day some well-intentioned 
Fundamentalists applied for permission to search for the remains of 
the Ark on Mount Ararat. They were impatiently denied access 
by the Soviet authorities, who suspected espionage with a CIA 
cover name. No one, they figured, could be that simpleminded. The 
simplemindedness obviously extends to the researchers of the Su- 
merological Institutes, who went looking for Eridu in the Persian 
Gulf, and for the dwelling of the divine barmaid Siduri on the 
shores of the Mediterranean. But it is evident that the events of the 
Flood in the Era Epic, however vivid their language, apply unmis¬ 
takably to events in the austral heavens and to nothing else. 

It becomes evident that all the adventures of Gilgamesh, even 
if ever so earthily described, have no conceivable counterpart on 
earth. They are astronomically conceived from A to Z—even as the

Tallqvist, s.v. Gilgamesh. Albright calls Gilgamesh “torch-fecundating hero 
(JAOS 40, p. 318). 





Hamlet’s Mill • 324 


fury of Era docs not apply to some meteorological “Lord Storm” 
but to events which arc imagined to take place among constella¬ 
tions. The authors of Sumer and Babylon describe their hair-raising 
catastrophes of the Flood without a thought of earthly events. 
Their imagination and calculations as well as their thought belong 
wholly among the stars. Their capacity for transposition seems to 
have been utterly lost to us earthlings, of the earth earthy, who 
think only of “primitive” images and primitive experiences, which 
could account for the narrative so intensely and humanly projected. 
Perhaps they are mutants from our type. In any case they seem be¬ 
yond the comprehension of mature contemporary intellects, who 
have adjusted comfortably to the mental standards of Desmond 
Morris’ Naked Ape of their own devising. 

These phantoms being now laid to rest, one finds oneself dealing 
with utterly unknown ancestors, whose biblical rages and passions 
have to be read in an entirely new context. To be sure, the planets 
are still neighbors: Mars, who is Era and Nergal, is only a few 
light-minutes away, Marduk-Jupiter about eight minutes, Saturn an 
hour. But they are all equally lost in cosmic space, their optical 
evidence, like that of ghosts, equally unseizable, equally potent or 
impotent in terms of present physical standards, equally and dread¬ 
fully present according to those other standards. 

Era is sternly reprimanded by Jupiter/Marduk for having sent 
his weapons forth to destroy what remained after the Flood (Ea 
once spoke in the same vein to Enlil after the earlier Flood) but 
Marduk saved seven wise ones ( ummani) by causing them to de¬ 
scend to the Apsu or Abyss, and to the precious 7 /zes-trees by chang¬ 
ing their places. “Because of this work, O hero, which thou didst 
command to be done, where is the 7 ;/e.y-tree, flesh of the gods, 
adornment of kings?” “The mesu-tTtt," says Marduk, “had its 
roots in the wide sea, in the depth of Arallu, and its top attained 
to high heaven.” He asks Era where are the lapis lazuli, the gods 
of the arts, and the seven wise ones of the Apsu. He might well 
ask where is Gilgamesh himself, that deceptively human hero, now 
transformed into a beacon of light from a mes-tTtz of other-worldly 
dimensions. Such is the fate of heroes, as they have been followed 







325 • Gilgamesh and Prometheus 

from Amlodhi onwards, whether they come as a spark hiding in a 
narthex like Prometheus, or fire from the wood splinters in Stag’s 
hairs, or become a beam from Canopus-Eridu. Lost in the depths of 
the Southern Ocean, they were capable of giving the Depths of the 
Sea to our forefathers, and now are able to have the directional 
systems of our missiles lock on them for interplanetary flight—they 
remain points, circles, geometries of light to guide mankind past 
and future on its way. 

And so under the present circumstances it is necessary to leave 
Era’s somber prophecy unfulfilled, relating as it does to a coming 
world age: 

Open the way, I 'will take the road , 

The days are ended, the fixed time has past. 

But with it comes the clearest statement ever uttered by men or 
gods concerning the Precession. Says Marduk: 

When I stood up from my seat and let the flood break in , 
then the judgement of Earth and Heaven went out of joint. .. 

The gods , which trembled , the stars of heaven — 
their position changed , and 1 did not bring them back.
