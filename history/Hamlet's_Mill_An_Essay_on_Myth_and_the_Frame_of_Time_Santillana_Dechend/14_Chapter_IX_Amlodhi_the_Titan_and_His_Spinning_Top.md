reasonable case has been made for the extreme antiquity 
and continuity of certain traditions concerning the heavens. Even if 
Amlodhi’s Quern, the Grotte and the Sampo as individual myths 
cannot be traced back beyond the Middle Ages, they arc derived 
in different ways from that great and durable patrimony of astro¬ 
nomical tradition, the Middle East. 

Now it is time to locate the origin of the image of the Mill, and 
further, what its alleged breakup and the coming into being of the 
Whirlpool can possibly mean. 

The starting place is Greece. Cleomedcs (c. a.d. 150), speaking 
of the northern latitudes, states (7.7): “The heavens there turn 
around in the way a millstone does.” Al-Farghani in the East takes 
up the same idea, and his colleagues will supply the details. They 
call the star Kochab, beta Ursae Minoris, “mill peg,” and the stars 
of the Little Bear, surrounding the North Pole, and Fas al-rahha 
(the hole of the mill peg) “because they represent, as it were, a hole 
(the axle ring) in which the mill axle turns, since the axle of the 
equator (the polar axis) is to be found in this region, fairly close

to the star Al-jadi (hc-goat, Polaris: alpha Ursae Minoris).” These 
are the words of the Arab cosmographer al-Kazvini. Ideler com¬ 
ments: 1 

Kotb , the common name of the Pole, means really the axle of the 
movable upper millstone w hich goes through the lower fixed one, 
what is called the “mill-iron.” On this ambiguity is founded the anal¬ 
ogy mentioned by Kazvini. The sphere of heaven was imagined as a 
turning millstone, and the North Pole as the axle bearing in which the 
mill-iron turns .. . Fas is explained by Giggeo ... as rima, scissura etc. 
. . . The Fas al-rahha of our text, which stands also in the Dresden 
globe beside the North Pole of the Equator, should therefore repre¬ 
sent the axle bearing. 

Farther to the east, in India, the Bloagavata Pur ana tells us how 
the virtuous prince Dhruva was appointed as Pole star. 2 The par¬ 
ticular “virtue” of the prince, which alarmed even the gods, is 
worth mentioning: he stood on one leg for more than a month, 
motionless. This is what was announced to him: “The stars, and 
their figures, and also the planets shall turn around you.” Accord¬ 
ingly, Dhruva ascends to the highest pole, “to the exalted seat of 
Vishnu, round which the starry spheres forever wander, like the 
upright axle of the corn mill circled without end by the labouring 
oxen.” 

The simile of the oxen driven around is not alien to the West. It 
has remained in our languages thanks to the Latin Septemtriones , 
the seven threshing oxen of Ursa Major: “that we are used to call¬ 
ing the Seven Oxen,” according to Cicero’s translation of Aratus. 

On a more familiar level there is a remark by Trimalchio in Pe- 
tronius ( Satyricon 39): “Thus the orb of heaven turns around like 
a millstone, and ever does something bad.” It was not a foreign idea

vatam of Krishna-Dijeaipayana Vyasa 5.3 (trans. J. N. Sanyal, vol. 2, pp. 248!.): 
“Just as oxen, fastened to a post fixed in the center of a threshing floor, leaving 
their own station, go round at shorter, middle or longer distances, similarly fixed 
on the inside and outside of the circle of time, stars and planets exist, supporting 
themselves on Dhruva; and propelled by the wind, they range in every direction 
till the end of a kalpa.”

to the ancients that the mills of the gods grind slowly, and that the 
result is usually pain. 

Thus the image travels far and wide by many channels, reaches 
the North by way of Celtic-Scandinavian transmission and appears 
in Snaebjorn’s account of his voyage of discovery in the Arctic. 
There should be added to those enigmatic lines of his what is known 
now of the background in Scandinavian lore. The nine grim god¬ 
desses who “once ground Amlodhi’s meal,” working now that 
“host-cruel skerry quern” beyond the edge of the world, are in 
their turn only the agents of a shadowy controlling power called 
Mundilfoeri, literally “the mover of the handle” (appendix #15). 
The word mundil, says Rydberg, “is never used in the old Norse 
literature about any other object than the sweep or handle with 
which the movable millstone is turned,” 3 and he is backed by 
Vigfusson’s dictionary which says that “mundil” in “Mundilfoeri” 
clearly refers to “the veering round or revolution of the heavens.” 

The case is then established. But there is an ambiguity here 
which discloses further depths in the idea. “ ‘Moendull’ comes from 
Sanskrit ‘Manthati,’ ” says Rydberg, “it means to swing, twist, bore 
(from the root manth-, whence later Latin mentula ), which occurs 
in several passages in the Rigveda. Its direct application always 
refers to the production of fire by friction.” 4 

So it is, indeed. But Rydberg, after establishing the etymology, 
has not followed up the meaning. The locomotive engineers and 
airplane pilots of today who coined the term “joy stick” might have 
guessed. For the Sanskrit Pra-mantha is the male fire stick, or churn 
stick, which serves to make fire. And Pramantha has turned into 
the Greeks’ Prometheus, a personage to whom it will be necessary 

3 V. Rydberg, Teutonic Mythology (1907), pp. 581ft. Webster's New Interna¬ 
tional Dictionary , 2d ed., lists “mundle”: A stick for stirring. Obsolete except for 
dialectical use. (We are indebted for this reference to Airs. Jean Whitnack.) 

4 To term it “friction” is a nice way to shut out dangerous terms: actually, the 
Sanskrit radical math , manth means drilling in the strict sense, i.e., it involves al¬ 
ternate motion (see H. Grassmann, Worterbuch zum Rig-Veda [1955], pp. 976ft) 
as we have it in the famous Amritamanthana, the Churning of the Milky Ocean, 
and this very quality of India’s churn and fire drill has had far-reaching influence 
on cosmological conceptions.

to come hack frequently. What seems to be deep confusion is in 
reality only two differing aspects of the same complex idea. The 
lighting of fire at the pole is part of that idea. But the reader is not 
the first to be perplexed by an imagery which allows for the pres¬ 
ence of planets at the pole, even if it were only for the purpose of 
kindling the “fire” which was to last for a new age of the world, 
that world-age which the particular “Pramantha” was destined to 
rule. The handle, “mocndull,” and the fire drill arc complemen¬ 
tary: both have had great developments which superimpose on each 
other and on a multitude of myths. The obstacles which imagina¬ 
tion has to overcome are the associations which arc connected spon¬ 
taneously with “fire,” that is, the real burning fire in chimney or 
hearth, and the kind of “fire” associated with the mentioned “joy 
stick.” Both arc irrelevant as far as cosmological terminology is 
concerned, but they lent the linguistic vehicle which was used to 
carry the ideas of astronomy and alchemy. 

It should be stated right now that “//re” is actually a great circle 
reaching from the North Pole of the celestial sphere to its South 
Pole , whence such strange utterances as Rigveda y.13.6: “Agni! 
I low the felly 5 the spokes, thus you surround the gods.” (Agni is 
the so-called “fire-god,” or the personified fire.) The Atharva Veda 
says, moreover, that the fire sticks belong to the skambha , 6 the 
world’s axis, the very skambha from which the Sampo has been 
derived (see above, p. 111). 

The identity of the Mill, in its many versions, with heaven is 
thus universally understood and accepted. But hitherto nobody 
seems to have wondered about the second part of the story, which 
also occurs in the many versions. 1 low and why docs it always 
happen that this Mill, the peg of which is Polaris, had to be wrecked 
or unhinged? Once the archaic mind had grasped the forever- 
enduring rotation, wlvat caused it to think that the axle jumps out 
of the hole? What memory of catastrophic events has created this

(i /0.8.20. Cf. RV to. 24.4 and to. 184.3 with Gcldncr’s remark that in this stanza of 
the Atharva Veda the fire sticks are treated as a great secret and attributed to

story of destruction- Why should Yainamoinen (and he is not the 
only one) state explicitly that another Mill has to be constructed 
(see p. 11 o) r Why had Dhruva to be appointed to play Pole star— 
and for a given cycle?’ For the story refers in no way to the crea¬ 
tion of the world. One might even ask. as the alternative solution 
to Rydberg's challenging “limb-grist." whether Bergelmer was not 
heaved in the same manner “upon the millstone." that is. appointed 
to play Pole star (see above, p. 92). 

The simple answer lies in the facts of the case. The Pole star 
docs get out of place, and every few thousand years another star 
has to be chosen which best approximates that position. It is well 
known that the Great Pyramid, so carefully sighted, is not oriented 
at our Pole Star but at alpha Draconis. which occupied the position 
at the pole 5.000 years ago. But. as has been mentioned above ( In¬ 
termezzo. p. 66). it is the more difficult for moderns to imagine 
that in those far-off ages men could keep track of such impercep¬ 
tible shifting, as many of them are not aware of the mere facts. As 
Dr. Alexander Pogo. the Palomar astronomer, has written in frus¬ 
tration: "I give up quoting further examples of the obstinate belief 
of our Egyptologists in the immobility of the heavenly pole."* 

Yet there is quite a collection of myths to show that once upon 
a time it was realized that the sphere of fixed stars is not meant to 
circle around the same peg forever and ever. Several myths tell how 
Polaris is shot down, or removed in some other way. That is re¬ 
served for an appendix (=15). 

Most of these myths, however, come under a misleading name. 
They have been understood to deal with the end of the world. But 
there are extremely few “eschatological" myths entitled to this 
label. For example, the Twilight of the Gods is understood as the 
world's end, yet there is unambiguous testimony to the contrary 
from the Yoluspa and other chapters of the Edda. What actually 
comes to an and is a world, in the sense of a world-age. The catas- 

'The Vishnu Puranj /.12 (cf. 2.S. p. 1S7 of the Wilson translation) betrays the 
Indian predilection for huge and unrealistic numbers and periods: Dhnwa is meant 
to last one kjlp.r —4.5:0,000 years.

trophe cleans out the past, which is replaced by “a new heaven 
and a new earth,” and ruled by a “new” Pole star. The biblical 
flood was also the end of a world, and Noah’s adventure is re¬ 
hearsed in many traditions and many forms all over the planet. The 
Greeks knew of three successive destructions. 

Coherence will be re-established in this welter of traditions if it 
is realized that what is referred to is that grandest of heavenly 
phenomena, the Precession of the Equinoxes. The phenomenon has 
been dealt with in the Intermezzo already, but it is essential enough 
to be taken up more than once. Being so slow, and in a man’s age so 
imperceptible, it has been taken for granted 9 that no one could have 
detected the Precession prior to Hipparchus’ alleged discovery 
of the phenomenon, in 127 b.c. Hipparchus discovered and proved 
that the Precession turns around the pole of the ecliptic. 10 It is said 
that it must have taken an almost modern instrumentation to detect 
the motion over the brief space of a century, and this is certainly 
correct. Nobody claims, however, that the discovery was deduced 
from observations during one century. And the shift of 1 degree in 
72 years, piling up over centuries, will produce appreciable shifts 
in certain crucial positions, if the observers have enough intentness 
of mind and know how to keep records. The technique of observa¬ 
tion was relatively simple. It was based on the heliacal rising of 
stars, which remained a fundamental feature in Babylonian astron¬ 
omy. The telescope of early times, as Sir Norman Lockyer has said, 
was the line of the horizon. If you came to realize that a certain star, 
which was wont to rise just before the equinoctial sun, was no 
longer visible on that day, it was clear that the gears of heaven 
had shifted. If that star was the last one of a given zodiac figure, it 
meant that the equinox was moving into a new figure. Nor is there 
any doubt—as was already said—that far antiquity was already 
aware of the shifting of the Pole star. But was it capable of con- 

9 I.c., during the last hundred years, at least. In former times, when the Humani¬ 
ties had not vet been “infected” by the biological scheme of evolution, the 
scholars showed better confidence in the capacities of the creators of high civili¬ 
zation. 

10 See Ptolemy, Symaxis 7.3 (Manitius trans., vol. 2 , pp. 16f.). The magnitude 
calculated by Hipparchus and accepted by Ptolemy was 1 degree in ioo years.

necting both motions? This is where modern specialists, operating 
each from his own special angle of vision, have long hesitated. 

What is the Precession? Very few have troubled to learn about 
it, yet to any man of our time, who knows the earth to be spinning 
around on her axis, the example of a spinning top with its inclined 
axis slowly shifting around in a circle makes the knowledge intui¬ 
tive. Anyone who has played with a gyroscope will know all about 
the Precession. As soon as its axis is deflected from the vertical, the 
gyroscope will start that slow and obstinate movement around the 
compass which changes its direction while keeping its inclination 
constant. The earth, a spinning top with an axis inclined with re¬ 
spect to the sun’s pull, behaves like a giant gyroscope, which per¬ 
forms a full revolution in 25.920 years. 

Antiquity was not likely to grasp this, since dynamics came into 
this world only with Galileo. Hipparchus and Ptolemy could not 
understand the mechanism. They could only describe the motion. 
We must try to see through their eyes, and think only in terms of 
kinematics. Over a period of a thousand years ancient observers 
could discern in the secular shifting of the Great Gyroscope (it is 
here in fact that the word “secular” now used in mechanics origi¬ 
nates) a motion through about ten degrees. Once attuned to the 
secular motion, they were able to detect, in the daily whirring of 
heaven around the pole, in its yearly turning in the round of the 
seasons, in the excruciatingly slow motion of the pole over the 
years, a point which seemed intrinsically more stable than the pole 
itself. It was the pole of the ecliptic, 11 often referred to as the Open 
Hole in Heaven because in that region there is no star to mark it. 
The symmetries of the machine took shape in their minds. And 
truly it was the time machine, as Plato understands it, the “moving 
image of eternity.” The “mighty marching and the golden burn¬ 
ing,” cycle upon cycle, even down to shifts barely perceptible over 
the centuries, were the Generations of Time itself, the cyclical sym- 

11 Sec A. Bouche-Leclerq, VAstrologie Grecque (1899), p. 122: “On sait que le 
pole par excellence etait pour les Chaldeens le pole de Tecliptique, lequel est dans 
la constellation du Dragon.” Cf. also A. Kircher, Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1653), vol. 
2, pt. 2, p. 205: “Ponebant Aegyptii non Aequatorem, sed Zodiacum basis loco; ita 
ut centrum hemispherii utriusque non polum Mundi, sed polum Zodiaci referret.”

bol of everlastingness: for, as Aristotle says, what is eternal is circu¬ 
lar, and what is circular is eternal. 

Vet this uniformly working time machine could be marked 
with important stations. The gyroscopic tilt causes a continual 
shifting of our celestial equator, which cuts the inclined circle of 
the ecliptic along a regular succession of points, moving uniformly 
from east to west. Now the points where the two circles cross are 
the equinoctial points. Hence the sun, moving on the ecliptic 
through the year, meets the equator on a point which shifts steadily 
with the years along the ring of zodiacal signs. This is what is meant 
by the Precession of the Equinoxes. They “precede” because they 
go against the order of the signs as the sun establishes this in its 
yearly march. The vernal equinox—we called it the “fiducial point” 
previously—which was traditionally the opening of spring and the 
beginning of the year, will take place in one sign after another. This 
gives great meaning to the change of signs in which the equinoctial 
sun happens to rise. 

Some additional words of guidance may be called for here, where 
“signs” are mentioned—those “in” which the sun rises. For roughly 
two thousand years official terminology has used only zodiacal 
“signs,” each of which occupies 30 degrees of the 360 degrees of the 
whole circle. These signs have the names of the zodiacal constella¬ 
tions, but constellations and signs are not congruent, the equinoctial 
sign (— i° — 30°) being called Aries regardless of the constellation 
that actually rises before the equinoctial sun. In our time, the constel¬ 
lation rising heliacally on March 21 is Pisces, but the “sign” preserves 
the name Aries, and will continue to do so when in the future 
Aquarius rules the vernal equinox. So much for sign versus constel¬ 
lation. 12 As concerns the second ambiguous expression, namely, the 

12 Here, we leave out of consideration the much discussed question of exactly 
when signs of equal length were first introduced; allegedly it was very late (see be¬ 
low, p. 431, n. 1). The actual constellations differ widely in length—the huge Scor¬ 
pion, e.g., covers many more degrees than 30, whereas the Ram is of modest dimen¬ 
sions. One would think that this lack of uniformity would have so hampered the 
ancient astronomers in making their calculations that they would have worked out 
a more convenient frame of coordinates in sheer self-defense. 










145 * Amlodhi the Titan and His Spinning Top 

sun’s rising “in” a constellation (or a sign)—this means that the sun 
rises together with this constellation, making it invisible. There are 
several reasons for assuming that a constellation (and a planet which 
happened to be there), “in” which the equinoctial sun rose, was 
termed to be “sacrificed,” “bound to the sacrificial post,” and the 
like; and this might explain eventually why Christ, who opened the 
world-age in which Pisces rose heliacally in the spring, was under¬ 
stood as the sacrificed lamb. When Pisces is the last constellation 
visible in the east before sunrise, the sun rises together, i.e., “in,” the 
constellation following next, the Ram. 

Since the beginning of history, the vernal equinox has moved 
through Taurus, Aries, and Pisces. This is all that historic experi¬ 
ence has shown mankind: a section of about one-quarter of the 
whole main circle of the machine. That it would come back full 
circle was at best an inference. It might also, for all men knew, 
have been part of an oscillation, back and forth, and in fact there 
were two schools of thought about it, and the oscillation theory 
seems to have exercised a greater attraction upon the mythographers 
of old. 

For us, the Copernican system has stripped the Precession of its 
awesomeness, making it a purely earthly affair, the wobbles of an 
average planet’s individual course. But if, as it appeared once, it 
was the mysteriously ordained behavior of the heavenly sphere, or 
the cosmos as a whole, then who could escape astrological emotion? 
For the Precession took on an overpowering significance. It became 
the vast impenetrable pattern of fate itself, with one world-age suc¬ 
ceeding another, as the invisible pointer of the equinox slid along 
the signs, each age bringing with it the rise and downfall of astral 
configurations and rulerships, with their earthly consequences. 
Tales had to be told for the people about how successions of ruler- 
ships arose from an origin, and about the actual creation of the 
world, but for those in the know the origin was only a point in 
the precessional circle, like the o = 24 of our dials. Our clocks today 
show two pointers only; but the tale-tellers of those bygone days, 
facing the immense and slow-moving machine of eternity, had to 





I Iamlet’s Mill • 146 

keep track of seven planetary pointers besides the daily revolution 
of the fixed sphere and of its secular motion in the opposite direc¬ 
tion. All these motions meant parts of time and fate. 

That things are not as they used to be, that the world is obvi¬ 
ously going from bad to worse, seems to have been an established 
idea through the ages. The unhinging of the Mill is caused by the 
shifting of the world axis. Motion is the medium by which the 
wrecking is brought about. The Adill is “transported,” be it Grotte 
or Sampo. The Grotte Song says explicitly that the giantesses first 
ground forth enemy action whereby the Mill was carried away and 
then, shortly afterwards, ground salt and wrecked the machine. It 
was the end of “Frodhi’s peace”—the Golden Age. Even in Snaeb- 
jorn’s famous lines, the grim goddesses “out at the edge of the world” 
are those “who ground Amlodhi’s meal in ages past.” They can 
hardly be doing it now, because the wrecked millstone is at the bot¬ 
tom of the sea, with its hole become the funnel of the whirlpool. So 
that Mill has been transferred to the waters, and it is now the sea 
itself which has become “Amlodhi’s churn.” The heavenly Mill has 
been readjusted, it goes on working in a new age. It churned once 
gold, then salt, and today sand and stones. But one cannot expect the 
rough Norse mythography to follow it in these legends, which are 
centered upon storm and wreck, the end of that first age. 

Even Hesiod is far from clear about the early struggles and cata¬ 
clysms; it is enough that in his Works and Days he marks a succes¬ 
sion of five ages. A more coherent picture can only be built out of 
the convergence of several traditions, and this shall be the task of 
further chapters. But right now, there is at least one age designated 
as the first, when the Mill ground out peace and plenty. It is the 
Golden Age, in Latin tradition, Saturnia regna, the reign of Saturn; 
in Greek, Kronos. In this dim perplexing figure there is an extraordi¬ 
nary concordance throughout world myths. In India it was Yama; 
in the Old Persian Avesta it was Yima xsaeta, 13 a name which became 
in New Persian Jamshyd; in Latin Saeturnus, then Saturnus. Saturn

or Kronos in many names had been known as the Ruler of the 
Golden Age, of that time when men knew not war and bloody 
sacrifices, not the inequality of classes—Lord of Justice and Mea¬ 
sures, as Enki since Sumerian days, the Yellow Emperor and legis¬ 
lator in China. 

If one wants to find the traces of his sunken Mill in classical 
mythology, they are not lacking. 14 The oldest is to be found where 
one would not expect it, in the Great Magical Papyrus of Paris, 
which is dated about the first half of the fourth century a.d. 15 In 
its recipes is the “much demanded Oracle of Kronos, the so-called 
Little Mill”: 

Take two measures of sea salt and grind it with a handmill, repeating 
all the while the prayer that I give you, until the God appears. If you 
hear while praying the heavy tread of a man and the clanking of 
irons, this is the god that comes with his chains, carrying a sickle. Do 
not be afraid, for you are covered by the protection that I give you. 
Be wrapped in white linen such as the priests of Isis wear [here fol¬ 
low a number of magic rites]. The prayer to be said while grinding 
is as follows: I call upon thee, great and holy One, founder of the 
whole world we live in, who sufferest wrong at the hands of thy own 
son, thee whom Helios bound with iron chains, so that All should not 
come to confusion. Man-Woman, father of thunder and lightning, 
thou who rulest also those below the earth. [There follow more rites 
of protection, then the formula of dismissal]: Go, Lord of the World, 
First Father, return to your own place, so that the All remain well 
guarded. Be merciful, O Lord . 16 

14 Although the Telchines are entitled to be investigated thoroughly, we can only 
mention them here: this strange family of “submarine magic spirits” and “demons 
of the depth of the sea”—they are followers of Poseidon in Rhodes—have invented 
the mill-, i.e., their leader did so— My las, “the miller.” Knowing beforehand, it was 
said, of the predestined flood which was to destroy Rhodes, these former inhabi¬ 
tants left for Lycia, Cyprus and Crete, the more so, as they also knew that Helios 
was going to take over the island after the flood. On the other hand, these envious 
creatures—they have the “evil eye,” too—are accused of having ruined the whole 
vegetation of Rhodes by sprinkling it with Styx-water. As will come out later 
(see “Of Time and the Rivers,” p. 200), the waters of Styx are not so easily 
to be had; that the Telchines, the “mill gods” ( theoi mylantioi) had access to Styx 
proves beyond doubt that these earliest defoliators had turned, indeed, into citizens 
of the deep sea. See Griechische Mythologie, Preller-Robert (1964), vol. 1, pp. 
650#.; Al. Mayer, Giganten und Titanen in der antiken Sage und Knnst (1887),

Sorcerers and conjurors are the most conservative people on 
earth. Theirs is not to reason why; they call upon the Power in 
terms they no longer understand, but they have to give an exact list 
of the archaic attributes of the fallen god, and even grind out sea 
salt from the Little Mill, the model of the whirlpool that marked his 
downfall. What had once been science has become with them pure 
technology, bent on preservation. A. Barb once coined a simile— 
he had revealed religion in mind, however, not science; dealing with 
the relation between magic practices and religion, he pointed to 
Matt, xxiv.28, Luke xvii.37: “Wheresoever the carcase is, there will 
the eagles be gathered together,” and “Too many critical scholars 
have been ready to assume that the carcase is therefore a creation 
of the eagles. But eagles do not create; they disfigure, destroy and 
dispense what life has left, and we must not mistake the colourful 
display of decay for the blossoms and fruit of life.” 17 Poignant as 
this image is, namely, in establishing the proper consecutio tem- 
porum, it leaves out of consideration the preserving function of 
magic and superstition: where would the historian of culture be 
left without those “eagles”? 

For all the titles and attributes here listed, there is justification in 
archaic myth. Right here, only one point is of importance. The 
Lord of the Mill is declared to be Saturn/Kronos, he whom his 
son Zeus dethroned by throwing him off his chariot, and banished 
in “chains” to a blissful island, where he dwells in sleep, for being 
immortal he cannot die, but is thought to live a life-in-death, 
wrapped in funerary linen, until his time, say some, shall come to
