Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? 

Or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? 

Job xxxyiii. / 6 

It will help now to take a quick comparative look at the differ¬ 
ent “dialects” of mythical language as applied to “Phaethon” in 
Greece and India. The Pythagoreans make Phaethon fall into Eri- 
danus, burning part of its water, and glowing still at the time when 
the Argonauts passed by. Ovid stated that since that fall the Nile 
hides its sources. Rigveda y.73.3 says that the Great Varuna has hid¬ 
den the ocean. The Mahabharata tells in its own style why the 
“heavenly Ganga” had to be brought down. 1 At the end of the 
Golden Age (Krita Yuga) a class of Asura who had fought against 
the “gods” hid themselves in the ocean where the gods could not 
reach them, and planned to overthrow the government. So the gods 
implored Agastya (Canopus, alpha Carinae = Eridu) for help. The 
great Rishi did as he was bidden, drank up the water of the ocean, 
and thus laid bare the enemies, who were then slain by the gods. But 
now, there was no ocean anymore! Implored by the gods to fill the 
sea again, the Holy One replied: “That water in sooth hath been 
digested by me. Some other expedient, therefore, must be thought 
of by you, if ye desire to make endeavour to fill the ocean.” It was 
this sad state of things which made it necessary to bring the 
Galaxy “down.” This is reminiscent of the detail in the Jewish 
tradition about Eben Shetiyyah, that the waters sank down so

deeply that David had to recite the “fifteen songs of ascension” to 
make them rise again. 

Now \gastya, the great Rishi, had a “sordid” origin similar to 
that of Krichthonios (Auriga), who was born of Gaia, “the Earth,” 
from the seed of Hephaistos who had dropped it while he was 
looking at Athena. 2 In the case of the Rishi: 

He originated from the seed of Mitra and Varuna, which they 
dropped into a water-jar on seeing the heavenly Urvashi. From this 
double parentage he is called Maitravaruni, and from his being born 
from a jar he got the name Khumbasambhava.” 3 [Khumba is the 
name of Aquarius in India and Indonesia, allegedly late Greek 
influence.] 

On the very same time and occasion there also was “born” as son 
of .Mitra and Varuna—only the seed fell on the ground not in the 
jar—the Rishi Vasishtha. This is unmistakably zeta Ursae Majoris, 
and the lining up of Canopus with zeta, more often with Alcor, the 
tiny star near zeta (Tom Thumb, in Babylonia the “fox”-star) has 
remained a rather constant feature, in Arabic Suhayl and as-Suha. 
This is the “birth” of the valid representatives of both the poles, 
the sons of Mitra and Varuna and also of their successors. To 
follow up the long and laborious way leading from Rigvedic 
Alitravaruna (dual) to the latest days of the Roman Empire where 
we still find a gloss saying “mithra funis, quo navis media vincitur ” 
—“mithra is the rope, by which the middle of the ship is bound,” 
would overstep the frame of this essay by far. Robert Eisler 4 rely¬ 
ing upon his vast material, connected this fetter of “rope,” mithra, 


2 Besides Greece and India, the motif of the dropped seed occurs in Caucasian 
myths, particularly those which deal with the hero Soszryko. The “Earth” is re¬ 
placed by a stone, Hephaistos by a shepherd, and Athena by the “beautiful Satana,” 
who watches carefully the pregnant stone and who, when the time comes, calls in 
the blacksmith who serves as midwife to the “stone-bom” hero whose body is blue 
shining steel from head to foot, except the knees (or the hips) which are damaged 
by the pliers of the smith. The same Soszryko seduces a hostile giant to measure 
the depth of the sea in the same manner as Michael or Elias causes the devil to 
dive, making the sea freeze in the meantime.

Egyptian Canopus is himself a jar-god; actually, he is represented by a Greek 
hydria (see RE s.v. Kanopos).

right away with the “ship’s belt” from the tenth book of Plato’s 
Republic. 

Of the inseparable dual A litra varuna, Varuna is still of greater 
relevance, particularly because it is he who “surveyed the first 
creation” (RV £.41.10), he who hid the Ocean—Ovid had it that 
the sources of the Nile were hidden—and he who is himself called 
“the hidden Ocean” (RV £.41.8). Varuna states about himself: “I 
fastened the sky to the seat of the Rita” (RV 4.42.2). And at that 
“seat of Rita” we find Svarnara, said to be “the name of the celestial 
spring . . . which Soma selected as his dwelling. 5 This is no other 
“thing” than Hvarna (Babylonian melamvm) which the “bad 
uncle” Afrasiyab attempted to steal by diving to the bottom of 
Lake Vurukasha, although Hvama belonged to Kai Khusrau (see 
above, pp. 40, 201). Thus in whichever dialect the phenomenon is 
spelled out. the fallen ruler of the Golden Age is held to dwell near¬ 
est to the celestial South Pole, particularly in Canopus which marks 
the steering oar of Argo, Canopus at the “confluence of the rivers.” 
This is true whether Varuna fastened the sky to the seat of the Rita 
(and his own seat), whether Enki-Ea-Enmesharra, dwelling in 
Eridu, held all the norms and measures (Rita, Sumerian me: Akka¬ 
dian: ptrrsu) —Thorkild Jacobsen called him very appropriately the 
“Lord modus operandi”—or whether Kronos-Saturn kept giving 
“all the measures of the whole creation” to Zeus while he himself 
slept in Ogygia-the-primeval. 

And there is little doubt, in fact none, that Phaethon (in the 
strange transformation scenes of successive ages) came to be under¬ 
stood as Saturn. There is the testimony of Erastosthenes’ Catas- 
terisms, 6 according to which the planet Saturn was Phaethon who 

5 See H. Liiders, Varuna , vol. 2: Varuna und das Rita (1959), pp. 396-401 (RV 

4.21.3; 8 .6. 39; p.70.6). Soma is addressed as “lord of the poles,” and to 

Agni is given the epithet svarnaram thrice (RV 2.2.1; 6.154; £.19.1; cf. Liiders, 
p. 400). But we did hear before about “Agni, like the felly the spokes, so you sur¬ 
round all the gods,” and Soma and Agni supplement each other, as will come out 
eventually, but not in this essay; the proportions Mitra: Varuna, Agni: Soma, 
Ambrosia: Nectar are not as easily computed as wishful thinking might expect. 

6 No. 43 (Robert ed., pp. 194L). E.g., Hyginus 11 42, dealing with the planets, be¬ 
ginning with Jupiter: “Secunda Stella dicitur Solis, quam alii Satumi dixerunt; hanc 
Eratosthenes a Solis filio Phaetonta adpellatam dicit, de quo complures dixerunt, 
ut patris inscienter curru vectus incenderit terras; quo facto ab love fulmine per- 
cussus in Eridanum deciderit et a Sole inter sidera sit perlatus.”

fell from the chariot into Eridanus, and Stephanus of Byzantium 7 
calls Phacthon a Titan. There is, moreover, the Orphic wording of 
the ease: “After Kronos had emasculated Ouranos, Zeus threw his 
father | Kronos] from the chariot and ‘entartarosed’ him” right 
away, if we translate the word literally. 8 Essential key words are 
easily mistaken for petty details, as in this case the “chariot,” from 
which Kronos/Phaethon was thrown into “Tartaros.” The vehicle 
in question is the two-wheeled race car, Greek harma, Latin currus, 
Babylonian narkabtu. It is the chariot of Auriga in Babylonia, sur¬ 
viving in the “Sphaera barbarica” of astrologers, 9 whereas in our 
Sphere the Charioteer is bereft of any vehicle. And, indeed, no other 
than Erichthonios (a Greek name for Auriga, besides Heniochos) 
is claimed to have invented the two-wheeled race car drawn by four 
horses (Erat. Catast. no. 13, pp. 98-101) which has to be distin¬ 
guished carefully from the even more important four-wheeled truck, 
the Big Dipper, that is, Greek hamaxa, Latin plaustruvi, Sumerian mul 
MAR.GID.DA = Charles’ Wain. 

Slightly perplexing traditions have come down in cuneiform 
texts, but they clearly allude to the same “event.” So, for in¬ 
stance, “The Elamitic chariot, without seat, carries the corpse of 
Enmesharra. The horses which are harnessed to it are the death- 
demon of Zu. The king who stands in the chariot is the hero-king, 
the Lord Ninurta.” Leaving aside the two last sentences which are, 
in reality, not so pitch dark as they look at first glance, the trans¬ 
lator, Erich Ebeling, 10 leaves no doubt that the “Elamitic chariot” 
is identical with the constellation “Chariot of Enmesharra,” which 
the authorities on Babylonian astronomy have identified with beta 
and zeta Tauri. 11 This Enmesharra now has a “telling” name: 
En./lfE.SARRA is “Lord of all the me,” that is, he is Lord of 
“norms and measures,” also called “Lord of the World Order,”

“Lord of the Universe = Ea” and, this is important, “the weighty 
one in the underworld” and “the sovereign of the underworld.” 12 

The “underworld” is misleading, though; the word is Arallu. The 
experts ge’nerally—not the Assyriologists alone—prefer to talk of 
navies, in plural, given to the one “underworld,” instead of trying 
to find out the precise whereabouts of the several provinces of that 
huge country, and to establish which name might properly fit every 
quarter. As if one did not know of the plurality of “hells” and 
“heavens.” Here, however, it is not necessary to bring order into 
the quarters of the Mesopotamian Hades, and for the time being, it 
suffices that the Lord of the World Order, Enmesharra, is Enki-Ea, 
because it is known anyhow that he dwells “at the seat of Rita”: 
Eridu-Canopus. And since “Enmesharra’s chariot” is the vehicle of 
Auriga, beta zeta Tauri, there can be little doubt that the tradition 
of Phaethon’s fall was already a Sumerian myth (appendix #22). 
And as in Greece, where the drastic version of the Orphics, of 
Hesiod and others are found side by side with those of Plutarch 
and Proclus, according to which Kronos gives with paternal grace 
“all the measures of the whole creation” to his son Zeus, 13 so, too, 
we have in Mesopotamia cruel-sounding variations besides “reason¬ 
able” ones. For example, when Marduk builds his “world” and 
receives fifty new names, his father Ea gives him his very own 
name, stating (EE 7.141L): “His name shall be Ea. All my com¬ 
bined rites he shall administer; all my instructions he shall carry 
out.” And as concerns Ea under the name of Enmesharra, Edzard 
states: “An incantation of Neo-Assyrian times, using an epithet of 
Enmesharra ‘Who transferred scepter and sovereignty to Anu and 
Enlil’ possibly hints to the voluntary abdication of the god.” 14 

One of the questions begging answers is, 'which measures are 
meant, and how does Saturn accomplish his assignment “to give

them continuously” to Jupiter? And, even if it is accepted that his 
“seat” is Canopus, how can he possibly give the measures from 
there? Without pretending to understand the scheme well for the 
time being, there arc some explanations which seem to be the most 
plausible ones. 

Above (p. 136), attention was called to the significance of the 
revolution of that Trigon which is built up by “Great Conjunc¬ 
tions” of Saturn and Jupiter, and was still understood by Kepler 
(sec figure). Now, whoever tries to imagine the degree of difficulty 
which faced the oldest “mythographers” will realize how welcome 
it must have been to find periods which fitted into each other at 
least approximately. This Trigon of Great Conjunctions presented 
itself as the instrument by which one could “narrow down” the 
almost imperceptible tempo of the Precession. To move through 
the whole zodiac, one of the angles of the Trigon needs approxi¬ 
mately 3 X 79414 — 2383 years. That comes tolerably near to one 
double-hour of the greatest “day” of the Precession of 25,900 years 
(appendix #23). A new zodiacal sign was termed to “rule” start¬ 
ing from the day of a great conjunction at the place of the “pas¬ 
sage.” The marginal point of Greek time-reckoning was the date 
of the first Olympic Games: they had been founded in memory 
of the wrestling of Kronos and Zeus, Pausanias said. The celestial 
constellation, however, ruling the different traditional dates of the 
first Olympic Games does not justify this claim; in other words, it 
is not known y'et which particular great conjunction it was in the 
memory of which the Games were supposed to have been intro¬ 
duced. Our own era, the Age of Pisces, started with a great con¬ 
junction in Pisces, in the year 6 b.c. 

By means of this Trigon, Saturn does give panta ta metra con¬ 
tinuously to his “son” Zeus, and this same Trigon appears to be 
called “genus” in the Orphic fragment already quoted (155 Kern), 
where Zeus addresses Kronos with the words, “Set in motion our 
genus, excellent Demon.” And Proclus alluded to it in his statement 
(ibid.), “And Kronos seems to have with him the highest causes of 
junctions and separations.” And still according to Macrobius he

was the “originator" of time (Sat. 7.22.8: “Saturnus ipse qui auctor 
est temporum.’’). 15 

So much for Saturn the unalterable planet gliding along his orb. 
Saturn as the fallen ruler of the Golden Age and retired to Eridu 
is a much harder proposition. Although there is also evidence to the 
contrary, there are many indications that the South Pole—Canopus 
—was taken for static, exempted from the Precession. 16 And this 

15 See R. Klibansky, E. Panofskv, and R. Saxl, Saturn and Melancholy (1964), 
pp. 154L Cf. pp. 333L, with quotations from the Latin translation of Abu Ma’shar, 
where Saturn “significat . . . quantitates sive mensuras rerum,” and where “eius est 
... rerum dimensio et pondus.” 

16 We have neither time nor space to deal sufficiently with the relevant and 
copious information on the “joyful” South Pole (see L. Ideler, Stemnamen , 
pp. 265L), the “Kotb Suhayl” of the Arabians, called thus after Canopus, which is 
recognized in Fezzan as Tetoile primordiale Sahel, identifie au premier ciel con- 
tenant les constellations a venir” (V. Paques, Uarbre cosviique [1964], p. 36) — 
the primordial star, “presented under the form of an egg that contained all the 
things that were to be born” (Paques, p. 47). To begin discussing the static 
South Pole, one might well start with the “Seven Sleepers of Ephesus,” who were 
thought to be on board the Argo —even if this is explicitly stated only in very 
late Turkish tradition (16th century)—particularly from Louis Massignon’s article, 
“Notes sur les Xuages de Magellan et leur utilisation par les pilotes arabes dans 
TOcean Indien: sous le signe des VII Dormants” (Revtie des Etudes Islavnques 
[1961], pp. 1-18 = part VII of Massignon's series of articles on the Seven Sleepers 
in Islamic and Christian tradition; part I appeared in the same review in 1955, 
part VIII in 1963), and in the very substantial review article by T. Monod, 
“Le ciel austral et Torientation (autour d'un article de Louis Massignon)” (Bulle- 
tin de l'lnstitut Frcmgais d'Afrique Xoire [1963], vol. 25, ser. B, pp. 415-26). In 
both articles one finds, besides the surprising notion of the happy South, note¬ 
worthy information about human migrations directed toward the South in several 
continents. Massignon derived the “lucky” significance of the Kotb Suhayl and the 
Magellanic Clouds from historical events; i.e., from the expectations of exiled and 
deprived peoples escaping from the perpetual wars and raids in the northern coun¬ 
tries: “Xomades ou marins, ces primitifs expatries n’eurent pour guides, dans leur 
migrations et leur regards desesperes, que les ‘etoiles nouvelles du ciel austral” 
(1961, p. 12). Monod (p. 422), however, pointed to the crucial key word as given 
by Ragnar Xumelin ( Les Migrations Hwnaines [1939], p. 27072.), who remarked: 
“II est possible que beaucoup de ces mysterieuses peregrinations se proposaient 
comme but de trouver Tetoile immobile ? dont parle la tradition. Le culte de l’Etoile 
Polaire peut avoir provoque de tels voyages,” annihilating thus with the second 
sentence the treasure which he had detected in the first. But Massignon and 
Monod also missed the decisive factor, namely, that the South Pole of the ecliptic 
is marked by the Great Cloud, and that Canopus is rather near to this south ecliptic 
pole, whereas the immovable center in the North of the universe is not distin¬ 
guished by any star, as has been said previously.

would mean—at least it might mean, because it fits so well into 
those notions of “time and the rivers”—that expired periods return 
“home” into timclessncss, that they flow into eternity whence they 
came. Access to the Confluence of the Rivers, Mouth and Source 
of aeons and eras, the true scat of immortality, has always been 
denied to any aspect of “time, the moving likeness of eternity.” For 
eternity excludes motion. But from this desired motionless home, 
source and mouth of times, the world-ruler has to procure the 
normed measures valid for his age; they are always based on time, 
as has been said. Again it is the same whether it was Marduk who 
first “crossed the heavens and surveyed the regions. He squared 
Apsu’s quarter, the abode of Nudimud [= Ea]. As the lord mea¬ 
sured the dimensions of Apsu,” and then erected his palace as the 
“likeness” of Apsu, or whether it was Sun the Chinese Monkey 
who fetched his irresistible weapon from the “navel of the deep”— 
an enormous iron pillar by means of which, once upon a time, 
Yu the Great had plumbed out the utmost depth of the sea. In any 
case, whether the description is sublime or charmingly nonsensical, 
it is literally the “fundamental” task of the Ruler to “dive” to the 
topos where times begin and end, to get hold of a new “first day.” 
As the Chinese say, in order to rule over space one has to be master 
of time. 

The reader may suspect by now that Hamlet has been forever 
forgotten. The way has been long and circuitous, but the connec¬ 
tion is still there. Even in so late and damaged a tradition as that 
of Saxo Grammaticus, every motif once made sense in high and 
far-off times. If it is difficult to recognize the central significance of 
the “oar” of Odysseus, 17 how much more difficult is it to spot the 

For the fun of it, a note of Monod’s should be quoted here (p. 421): “Quand 
Voltaire nous dit que Zadig ‘dirigeait sa route sur les etoiles’ et que ‘la constella¬ 
tion d’Orion, et le brillant astre de Sirius le guidaient vers le pole de Canope’, nous 
retrouvons dans cette derniere expression un temoignage du role joue par Canopus 
dans l’orientation astronomique. II n’y a pas lieu, bien entendu, de vouloir la cor- 
riger en ‘port de Canope’; cf. Voltaire, Romans et contes , ed. Gamier i960, note 
49, p. 621.” Where shall we ever find security from the “improvements” of 
philologists? 

17 Sooner or later, one more object will have to be admitted to the assembly of 
imperial measuring oars, or gubernacula: the enigmatical Egyptian hpt, the so-

“steering oar of Argo” = Canopus-Eridu, in the childish riddle of 
Amlethus? And yet, the “measuring of the depth of the sea” is there 
all the time; infant-Kullervo dared to do it with a ladle, coming to 
the startling result of “three ladles and a little bit more.” And there 
is an even less suitable measure to be had, a veritable stylus. Jacob 
Grimm gives the story: “The medieval Dutch poem of Brandaen 
. . . contains a very remarkable feature: Brandaen met on the sea 
a man of thumb size, floating upon a leaf, holding in his right hand 
a small bowl, in the left hand a stylus; the stylus he kept dipping 
into the sea and letting water drip from it into the bowl; when the 
bowl was full, he emptied it out, and began filling it again. It 
was imposed on him, he said, to measure the sea until Judgment- 
day.” 18 This particular kind of “instrument” seems to reveal the 
surveyor in charge in this special case. Mercury was the celestial 
scribe and guardian of the files and records, “and he was the in¬ 
ventor of many arts, such as arithmetic and calculation and geom¬ 
etry and astronomy and draughts and dice, but his great discovery 
was the use of letters,” as Plato has it (Phaedrus 274). 

It remains to be seen whether or not all the measuring planets 
can be recognized by their particular methods of doing the measur¬ 
ing. It is known how Saturn does it, and Jupiter. Jupiter “throws,” 
and Saturn “falls.” But, as was said before, Saturn giving the meas¬ 
ures as resident in Canopus is hard to imagine. Maybe all the avail¬ 
able keys to this door have not been tried? Observing so many char¬ 
acters occupied with measuring the depth of the sea, one stumbles 
over the strange name given to Canopus by the Arabs: they call it 

called “ship’s device” (Schiffsgerat) of obscure literal meaning, which the Pharaoh 
brought running to a deity in the ritual of the “oar-race.” There was also a “jar- 
race” and a “bird-race,” the Pharaoh carrying a water jar or a bird, respectively. 
In several Pyramid Texts the soul of the dead ruler takes this ship’s device and 
brings it to another celestial department, while the actual rowing of the boat is 
done by the stars (Pyr. 2173A, d; see also 284A, 873D, 1346B). See Aeg. Wb., vol. 5, 
pp. 67-71; A. Gardiner, Egyptian Grammar (1957), p. 581; M. Riemschneider, 
Augengott und Heilige Hochzeit (1953), pp. 255E For the different imperial races, 
see the (unsatisfying) investigation by H. Kees, Der Opferta?7Z des Aegyptischen 
Konigs (1912), pp. 74-90, the “oar-race.” 

18 Deutsche Mythologie (1953), pp. 420/373. The English translation (TM, p. 451) 
makes it “pointer” instead of “stylus”; Grimm has “Griffel.” Cf. K. Simrock, 
Handbuch der Deutschen Mythologie (1869), § 125, p. 415.

“the weight,” and the Tables of Alphonsus of Castile spell it “Suhel 
ponderosus,” the heavy-weighing Canopus. 19 This “weight” is the 
plumb at the end of the plumb line, by means of which this depth 
was measured. So far so good. But where does Saturn come in? He 
can be understood as the “living” plumb line. 20 This would be hard 
to believe if the story of this surveying were not told by the plumb 
line itself, Phaethon. Only when he told it, he had another name, 
as belongs to the manners and customs of celestial characters: 
Hephaistos. 21 

In the first book of the Iliad (7.589!?.), Hephaistos tries to ap¬ 
pease his mother Hera who is very angry with her husband Zeus, 
and says to her: 

“It is hard to fight against the Olympian. There was a time once 
before now I was minded to help you and he caught me by the foot 
and threw me from the magic threshold, and all day long I dropped 
helpless, and about sunset I landed in Lemnos, and there was not much 
life left in me.” 

Hephaistos mentions the event once more, when Thetis asks him 
to forge the shield for her son Achilles (7^.395!?.): 

“She saved me when I suffered much at the time of my great fall 
through the will of my own brazen-faced mother, 22 who wanted to 
hide me, for being lame. Then my soul would have taken much 

19 “Suhail al wazn.” The epithet “wazn” has been given also to other stars of 
the southern sky. For ample discussions of this name, see Ideler, pp. 249-52, 263; 
Allen, pp. 68f.; J. N. Lockyer, The Dawn of Astronomy (1964), p. 294; W. T. 
Olcott, Star Lore of All Ages (1911), p. 133. 

20 The strange “beacon” in Aeschylus’ Agamemnon , which announced the Fall 
of Troy, must have been something of this kind; the context excludes absolutely 
any possible devices of the signal corps. 

21 To avoid misunderstanding, we do not wish to insist upon the absolute identity 
of the fall of Phaethon and the account of the fall as told by Hephaistos in the 
first book of the Iliad. We suspect that the verbal image “Jupiter-hurls-down- 
Saturn” describes the shaping of the Trigon of great conjunctions, not, however, 
of the Trigon generally but of that new Trigon whose first angle was established 
by a conjunction of the Big Two at the beginning of a new world-age. On the 
other hand, this picturesque formula might cover the shifting of the Trigon of 
conjunctions from one Triplicity to the next (cf. appendix #23); these highly 
technical problems cannot be solved yet. 

22 That is not what Homer says, it is kunopis, dog-eyed; Hera seems to have 
been near Sirius at that time.

The Chinese picture illustrates in true archaic spirit (which means that only hints 
are given, and the spectator has to work out for himself the significance of the 
details) the surveying of the universe. The two characters surrounded by constel¬ 
lations are Fu Hsi and Nu Kua, i.e., the craftsman god and his paredra, who 
measure the “squareness of the earth” and the “roundness of heaven” with their 
implements, the square with the plumb bob hanging from it, and the compass. 
The intertwined serpent-like bodies of the deities indicate clearly enough, al¬ 
though in a peculiar “projection,” circular orbits intersecting each other at regular 
intervals.

Indentured as a smith again, like Kullervo. 

Krates of Pergamon 23 explains this feature in the sense that Zeus 
aspired to the measurement of the whole world ( anametresin tou 
pantos). He succeeded in determining the measures of the cosmos 
by “two torches moving with the same speed”: Hephaistos and the 
Sun. Zeus hurled the former down from the threshold to earth at 
the same moment when the latter was starting from point east on 
his way to the west. Both reached their goal at the same time: the 
Sun was setting when Hephaistos struck Lemnos. 

Krates felt convinced that Homer spoke of a sphere, and since 
he himself was most interested in the coordinate system of the 
sphere he did not find it strange to interpret in his own sense the 
shield of Agamemnon ( Iliad //.32L) and of Achilles (/#.468ff.). 24 
He also conceived Odysseus’ sailing from Circe’s island to Hades 
as a voyage from the Tropic of Capricorn to the South Pole. The 
idea is not so strange as it might seem. Zeus, establishing the equi¬ 
noctial colure by hurling down the fictitious “Phaethon,” intro¬ 
duced a new skambha —one remembers Plato about this: “It has 
the air of a fable . . .” 25 But there is also Cornford’s idea of the 

23 It is to the credit of Hans Joachim Mette and his work, Sphairopoiia , Unter- 
suchungen zur Kosmologie des Krates von Yergamon (1936), that we find 
collected every relevant testimonial and fragment concerned with Krates and his 
topics.

25 We cannot discuss here the Homeric wording of the topos from which Zeus 
threw down Hephaistos: “magic threshold” means nothing, anyhow (apo belou 
thespesioio); there were ancient scholars who claimed that Krates connected this 
“belos” with the Chaldean “Bel”/Baal = Marduk. We leave it at Auriga’s chariot, 
Babylonian narkabtn , the more so, as Marduk, too, used it when tipping over 
Tiamat. The “Babylonian Genesis” does not tell that Marduk hurled people 
around, but there is a cuneiform text (VAT 9947) called by Ebeling ( Tod und 
Lebeti, 37L) “a kind of a calendar of festivals,” where it says: “the 17th is called 
(day) of moving in, when Bel has vanquished his enemies. The 18th is called (day) 
of lamentation, at which one throws from the roof Kingu and his 40 sons.” Kingu 
had the epithet “Enmesharra,” i.e., “Lord of norms and measures”; he was the hus¬ 
band of Tiamat—as Geb was husband of Nut—who gave him the “tablets of fate,” 
which Marduk was going to take away from him after his victory, and 40 is the

vision of F.r,- 6 according to which Plato’s “souls actually sec in their 
vision not the universe itself, but a model, a primitive orrery in a 
form roughly resembling a spindle . . 

It is sad to observe, and certainly odd, how little scholars trust 
their own eyes and words—as in the case of Jane Harrison who 
remarked on the Titans: “They are constantly driven down below 
the earth to nethermost Tartaros and always reemerging. The very 
violence and persistence with which they are sent below shows that 
they belong up above. They rebound like divine india-rubber 
balls.” 27 It is rather evident that these divine india-rubber balls were 
not really sent below: what was overthrown were the expired ages 
together with the names of their respective rulers. 

But now the galactical stage is empty and it is almost time to 
watch the working of the next skambha grinding out the “destiny” 
for the first postdiluvian generation. But before facing the hero of 
the oldest, the most difficult, and by all means the oddest of epics, 
there is an interval. We seize the occasion to insert a chapter on 
methods, presented by means of a well-known episode. 


number of Enki-Ea (see below, p. 288). The rest is easy to calculate. We are 
hampered by our inappropriate ideas about “names,” and by the misleading labels 
settled upon celestial characters by the translators who make Tiamat, Kingu and 
their clan into “monsters.”
