“Let us try, then, to set forth in 
our statement what things these 
are, and of what kind, and how 
one should learn them ... It is, 
indeed, a rather strange thing to 
hear; but the name that we, at 
any rate, give it—one that people 
would never suppose, from inex¬ 
perience in the matter—is astron¬ 
omy; people are ignorant that he 
who is truly an astronomer must 
be wisest, not he who is an as¬ 
tronomer in the sense understood 
by Hesiod . . . ; but the man who 
has studied the seven out of the 
eight orbits, each travelling over 
its own circuit in such a manner 
as could not ever be easily ob¬ 
served by any ordinary nature 
that did not partake of a marvel¬ 
lous nature.”

JL he strange exd of the Iranian tale, which concludes with an 
ascent to heaven like that of Elias, leaves the reader wondering. If 
this is the national epos (almost one half of it in content), where is 
the epic and the tragic element? In fact, there is a full measure of 
the Homeric narrative in Firdausi that had to be left aside, there are 
great battles as on the windy plains of Troy, challenges and duels, 
the incredible feats of heroes like Rustam and Zal, abductions and 
intrigues, infinite subplots to the tale, enough for a bard to entertain

his patrons for weeks and to ensure him a durable supply of 
haunches of venison. But the intervention of the gods in the tale 
is not so humanized as in the Iliad, although it shows through re¬ 
peatedly in complicated symbolism and bizarre fairy tales. The con¬ 
flict of will and fate is not to the measure of man. What has been 
traced above is a confusing story of dynastic succession under a 
shadowy Glory, a Glory without high events, keyed to a Hamlet 
situation and an unexplained melancholy. The essence is an unsub¬ 
stantial pageant of ambiguous abstractions, an elusive ballet of 
wildly symbolic actions tied to ritual magic and religious doctrines, 
with motivations which bear no parallel to normal ones. The whole 
thing is a puzzle to be interpreted through hymns—very much as 
in the Rigveda. 

But here at last there is given apertis verbis one key to the imag¬ 
ery: Khusrau’s crowning words: 

“The whole world is my kingdom: all is mine 
From Pisces downward to the Bull's head." 

If a hero of the western hemisphere were to proclaim: “All of 
this continent is mine, from Hatteras to Eastport,” he would be 
considered afflicted with a one-dimensional fancy. Does that stretch 
of coast stand in his mind for a whole continent? Yet here the 
words make perfect sense because Kai Khusrau does not refer to the 
earth. He designates that section of the zodiac comprised between 
Pisces and Aldebaran, the thirty degrees which cover the constel¬ 
lation Aries. It means that his reign is not only of heaven, it is essen¬ 
tially of Time. The dimension of heaven is Time. Kai Khusrau 
comes in as a function of time, preordained by events in the zodiac. 

“For from today new feasts and customs date ...” 

Why Aries, and what it all imports, is not relevant at this point. It 
turns out that “ruler of Aries” was the established title of supreme 
power in Iran , 1 and it may have meant as much or as little as “Holy 

1 Persia “belongs” to Aries according to Paulus Alexandrinus. See Boll’s Sphaera, 
pp. 296L, where it is stated that this was the oldest scheme. It is still to be found 
in the Apocalypse. Moses’ ram’s horns stand for the same world-age.

Roman Emperor” in the West. What counts is that Rome is a place 
on earth, whose prestige is connected with a certain historical pe¬ 
riod, whereas Aries is a zone of heaven, or rather, since heaven 
keeps moving, a certain time determined by heavenly motion in 
connection with that constellation. Rome is a historic fact, even 
“Eternal Rome,” which was once and then is left only to memory. 
Aries is a labeled time, and is bound to come back within certain 
cycles. 

Even if Kai Khusrau is conceived as a worldly ruler in an epos 
which prefaces history, it is clear that no modern historical or 
naturalistic imagination can provide the key to such minds as those 
of the Iranian bards out of whose rhapsodies the learned Firdausi 
organized the story. No basis in history can be found, no fertility 
or seasonal symbolism can be traced into it, and even the psycho¬ 
analysts have given up trying. This type of thought can be defined 
in one way: it is essentially cosmological. 

This is not to make things uselessly difficult, but to outline the 
real frame of mythical thought, such as is actually quite familiar 
and yet by now hardly recognized. It even appears in the mode of 
lyrical meditation, at least in the English of Fitzgerald: 

Iram indeed is gone with all its Rose 
And Jamshyd's Sev'n-ringed Cup where no one knows 
But still the Vine her ancient Ruby yields 
And still a Garden by the Water blows . 

And look—a thousand Blossoms with the Day 
Woke—and a thousand scatter'd into Clay 

And the first Summer month that brings the Rose 
Shall take Jamshyd and Kai Kubad away . 

But come with old Khayyam , and leave the lot 
Of Kai Kubad and Kai Khosrau forgot . . . 

Omar Khayyam may speak as a weary skeptic or as mystical Sufi, 
but all he speaks of is understood as real. The heroes of the past are 
as real as the friends for whom he is writing, as the vine and the 
roses and the waters, as his own direct experience of flux and im-

permanence in life. When he makes his earthenware pots to feel 
and think, it is no literary trope; it is the knowledge that all tran¬ 
sient things are caught in the same transmutation, that all substance 
is one: the stuff that pots and men and dreams are made of. 

This is what could be called living reality, and it is singularly 
different from ordinary or objective reality. When the poet thinks 
that this brick here may be the clay that was once Kai Khusrau, he 
rejoins Hamlet musing in the graveyard: “To what base uses we 
return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of 
Alexander till’a find it stopping a bung-hole?” Here are already 
four characters, two of them unreal, two lost in the haze of time, 
yet all equally present in our game, whereas most concrete charac¬ 
ters, say the Director of Internal Revenue, are not, however they 
may affect us otherwise. In that realm of “true existence” we shall 
find stars and vines and roses and water, the eternal forms, and it 
will include also the ideas of mathematics, another form of direct 
experience. The world of history is outside it as a whole. Khayyam 
does not, any more than Firdausi a generation later, mention the 
glories of Cyrus and Artaxerxes, but only mythical heroes, just as 
our own Middle Ages ignored history and spoke of Arthur and 
Gawain. It had been all “once upon a time,” and if Dante brings 
back myth so powerfully to life, it is because his own contempora¬ 
ries believed themselves truly descended from Dardanus and Troy, 
and wondered whether the Lord Ulysses might not still be alive; 
whereas Kaiser Barbarossa, asleep in his Kyffhauser mountain—that 
must surely be a fable like Snow White. Or is it? Fairy tales are 
easily dismissed for their familiar sound. But it might turn out that 
such great imperial figures turned into legend have a hidden life of 
their own, that they follow the laws of myth laid down long before 
them. Even as King Arthur did not really die but lives on in the 
depth of the mystic lake, according to Merlin’s prophecy, so God¬ 
frey of Viterbo (c. 1190), who had been in Barbarossa’s service, 
alone brings the “true” version. It is the orthodox one in strangely 
preserved archaic language: the Emperor sleeps on in the depth of 
the Watery Abyss (cf. chapter XI and appendix #33) where the 
retired rulers of the world are.

A distinction begins to appear between myth and fable. Hamlet 
is showing himself in the aspect of a true myth, a universal one. He 
is still that now. And Khayyam was the greatest mathematician of 
his time, the author of a planned calendar reform which turned out 
to be even more precise than the one that was adopted later as the 
Gregorian calendar, an intellect in whom trenchant skepticism 
could coexist with profound Sufi intellection. He knew full well 
that Jamshyd’s seven-ringed cup is not lost, since it stands for the 
seven planetary circles of which Jamshyd is the ruler, just as Jam¬ 
shyd’s magic mirror goes on reflecting the whole world, as it is the 
sky itself. But it is natural to let them retain their iridescent mys¬ 
tery, since they belong to the living reality, like Plato’s whorls and 
his Spindle of Necessity. Or like Hamlet himself. 

What then were Jamshyd or Kai Khusrau? To the simple, a 
magic image, a fable. To those who understood, a reflection of 
Time itself, obviously one of its major aspects. They could be 
recognized under many names in many places, even conflicting al¬ 
lusions. It was always the same myth, and that was enough. It 
expressed the laws of the universe, in that specific language, the 
language of Time. This was the way to talk about the cosmos. 

All that is living reality, sub specie transeuntis, has a tale, as it 
appears in awesome, or appalling, or comforting aspects, in the 
“fearful symmetry” of tigers or theorems, or stars in their courses, 
but always alive to the soul. It is a play of transmutations which 
include us, ruled by Time, framed in the eternal forms. A thought 
ruled by Time can be expressed only in myth. When mythical 
languages were universal and self-explanatory, thought was also 
self-sufficient. It could seek no explanation of itself in other terms, 
for it was reality expressed as living. As Goethe said, “Alles Ver- 
gangliche—ist nur ein Gleichnis.” 

Men today are trained to think in spatial terms, to localize ob¬ 
jects. After childhood, the first question is “where and when did it 
happen?” As science and history invade the whole landscape of 




Hamlet’s Mill • 48 

thought, the events of myth recede into mere fable. They appear 
as escape fantasies: unlocated, hardly serious, their space ubiquitous, 
their time circular. 

Yet some of those stories are so strong that they have lived on 
vividly. These are true myths. These personages are unmistakably 
identified, yet elusively fluid in outline. They tell of gigantic figures 
and superhuman events which seem to occupy the whole living 
space between heaven and earth. Those figures often lend their 
names to historical persons in passing and then vanish. Any attempt 
to tie them down to history, even to the tradition of great and 
catastrophic events, is invariably a sure way to a false trail. His¬ 
torical happenings will never “explain” mythical events. Plutarch 
already knew as much. Instead, mythical figures have invaded his¬ 
tory under counterfeit presentments, and subtly shaped it to their 
own ends. This is a working rule which was established long ago, 
and it has proved constantly valid if one is dealing with true myth 
and not with ordinary legends. To be sure, mythical figures are 
born and pass on, but not quite like mortals. There have to be char¬ 
acteristic styles for them like The Once and Future King. Were 
they once? Then they have been before, or will be again, in other 
names, under other aspects, even as the sky brings back forever its 
configurations. Surely, if one tried to pinpoint them as persons and 
things, they would melt before his eyes, like the products of sick 
fantasy. But if one respects their true nature, they will reveal that 
nature as junctions. 

Functions of what? Of the general order of things as it could be 
conceived. These figures express the behavior of that vast complex 
of variables once called the cosmos. They combine in themselves 
variety, eternity, and recurrence, for such is the nature of the cos¬ 
mos itself. That the cosmos might be infinite seems to have re¬ 
mained beyond the threshold of awareness of humankind up to the 
time of Lucretius, of Bruno and Galileo. And Galileo himself, who 
had serious doubts on the matter, agreed with all his predecessors 
that surely the universe is eternal, and that hence all its changes 
come under the law of periodicity and recurrence. “What is eter¬ 
nal,” Aristotle said, “is circular, and what is circular is eternal.” 




49 ' History, Myth and Reality 

That was the mature conclusion of human thought over millennia. 
It was, as has been said, an obsession with circularity. There is 
nothing new under the sun, but all things come back in ever-varying 
recurrence. Even the hateful word “revolution” referred once only 
to those of the celestial orbs. The cosmos was one vast system full 
of gears within gears, enormously intricate in its connections, which 
could be likened to a many-dialed clock. Its functions appeared and 
disappeared all over the system, like strange cuckoos in the clock, 
and wonderful tales were woven around them to describe their 
behavior; but just as in an engine, one cannot understand each part 
until one has understood the way all the parts interconnect in the 
system. 

Similarly, Rudyard Kipling in a droll allegory, “The Ship That 
Found Herself,” once explained what happens on a new ship in her 
shakedown voyage. All the parts spring into clamorous being as 
each plays its role for the first time, the plunging pistons, the groan¬ 
ing cylinders, the robust propeller shaft, the straining bulkheads, 
the chattering rivets, each feeling at the center of the stage, each 
telling the steam about its own unique and incomparable feats, until 
at last they subside into silence as a new deep voice is heard, that 
of the ship, who has found her identity at last. 

This is exactly what happens with the great array of myths. All 
the myths presented tales, some of them weird, incoherent or out¬ 
landish, and some epic and tragic. At last it is possible to understand 
them as partial representations of a system, as functions of a whole. 
The vastness and complexity of the system is only beginning to take 
shape, as the parts fall into place. The only thing to do is proceed 
inductively, step by step, avoiding preconceptions and letting the 
argument lead toward its own conclusions. 

In the simple story of Kai Khusrau, the Hamlet-like features are 
curiously preordained, although it is not clear to what end. The 
King’s power is explicitly linked, in time and space, with the mov¬ 
ing configurations of the heavens. It is common knowledge that 
heaven in its motion does provide coordinates for time and place 
on earth. The navigator’s business is to operate on this connection 
between above and below. But in the early centuries, the connec- 






Hamlet’s Mill • 50 

tion was infinitely richer in meaning. No historical monarch, how¬ 
ever convinced of his charisma, could have said: “The whole world 
is my kingdom, all is mine from Pisces to Aldebaran.” Earthly 
concepts seem to have been transferred to heaven, and inversely. 
In fact, this world of myth imbricates uranography and geography 
into a whole which is really one cosmography, and the “geographi¬ 
cal” features referred to can be mystifying, as they may imply 
either of these domains or both. 

For instance, when the “rivers” Okeanos or Eridanos are men¬ 
tioned, are they not conceived as being first in heaven and then 
eventually on earth, too? It is as if any region beyond ancient man’s 
direct ken were to be found simply “upwards.” True events, even 
in an official epic like the Shahnama, are not “earth-directed.” They 
tend to move “upwards.” This is the original form of astrology, 
which is both vaster and less defined than the later classic form 
which Ptolemy set forth. Even as the cosmos is one, so cosmogra¬ 
phy is made up of inextricably intertwined data. To say that events 
on earth reflect those in heaven is a misleading simplification to 
begin with. In Aristotelian language, form is said to be metaphys¬ 
ically prior to matter, but both go together. It is still necessary to 
discover which is the focus of “true” events in heaven. 

To recapitulate for clarity, whatever is true myth has no his¬ 
torical basis, however tempting the reduction, however massive and 
well armed the impact of a good deal of modern criticism on that 
belief. The attempt to reduce myth to history is the so-called “eu- 
hemerist” trend, from the name of Euhemeros, the first debunker. 
It was a wave of fashion which is now receding, for it was too 
simpleminded to last. Myth is essentially cosmological. As heaven in 
the cosmos is so vastly more important than our earth, it should not 
be surprising to find the main functions deriving from heaven. To 
identify them under a variety of appearances is a matter of mytho¬ 
logical judgment, of the capacity to recognize essential forms 
through patient sifting of the immense amount of material. 

Hamlet “is” here Kullervo, there Brutus or Kai Khusrau, but 
always recognizably the same. Jamshyd reappears as Yama among 
the Indo-Aryans, as Huang-ti, the Yellow Emperor, in China, and 





51 • History, Myth and Reality 

under many other names. There was always the tacit understanding, 
for those who spoke the archaic language, who were involved in 
the archaic cosmos, that he is everywhere the same function. And 
who is the Demiurge? He has many names indeed. Plato does not 
care to explain in our terms. Is this personage a semi-scientific fic¬ 
tion, the manufacturer of a planetarium, just as the Lost Continent 
of Atlantis is a semi-historical fiction? The author himself says only 
that such stories are “not quite serious.” Yet they are surely not a 
spoof. Plato, who shaped what is called philosophy and its language, 
who was the master of its penetrating distinctions, reverts to the 
language of myth when he feels he has to; and he uses that ancient 
language as if to the manner born. 2 

In this accounting for past myths, the heart of the problem re¬ 
mains elusive. Kipling was a writer still marvelously attuned to the 
juvenile mind that lives in most of us. But the fact is that myth it¬ 
self, as a whole, is a lost world. The last forms—or rehearsals—of 
a true myth took place in medieval culture: the Romance of Alex¬ 
ander, and the Arthurian myth as it is found in Malory.* 

There are other stories—we call them history—of man’s conquest 
over nature, the telling of the great adventure of mankind as a 
whole. But here it is only faceless social man who is winning man’s 
victories. It is not the history of technology; it is, if anything, 
science fiction that can bring in the adventures of the future. Science 
fiction, when it is good, is a wholly valid attempt at restoring a 
mythical element, with its adventures and tragedies, its meditations 
on man’s errors and man’s fate. For true tragedy is an essential com¬ 
ponent or outcome of myth. Possibly, history can be given a minute 


2 In his Seventh Letter (341C-344D) he denies strongly that scientific ‘‘names'’ and 
“sentences” ( onomata , remata) could assist in obtaining essential insight. Cf. also 
Clemens Alexandrinus, Stromata 5.9.58. 

* Still, there have been modern attempts deserving the name of myth. One, of 
course, is Sir Thomas More’s Utopia , which has taken on so much meaning through 
the centuries. We realize today that it, too, was partly oracular. And we should 
not forget Alice in Wonderland, the perfect nonsense myth, as significant and as 
nonsensical as the Kalevala itself. This parallel will appear relevant at the end of 
the appendices. Today, there is Austin Wright’s Islandia, which appeared in 1942, 
and its present sequel, The Islar, by Mark Saxton, to be published in the autumn 
of 1969. 




Hamlet’s Mill •

of timeliness and then dismissed with its load of interpretations and 
apprehensions that last as long as the reading—but the real present, 
the only thing that counts, is the eternal Sphinx. 

Today’s children, that impassive posterity to whom all reverence 
is due, know where to look for myths: in animal life, in the Jungle 
Books, in the stories of Lassie and Flipper, where innocence is un¬ 
assailable, in Western adventures suitably arranged by grownups 
for the protection of law and order. Much of the rest sedulously 
built up by mass media is modern prejudice and delusion, like the 
glamor of royalty, or the perfection of super-detergents and cos¬ 
metics: super-stitio, leftovers. So one might feel tempted to say: 
actually, however, no particle of myth today is left over, and we 
have to do only with a deliberate lie about the human condition. 
Tolkien’s efforts at reviving the genre, whatever the talent em¬ 
ployed, carry as much conviction as the traditional three-dollar bill. 

The assumed curious child would have been pleased only if he 
had been told the “story” of the engine just as Kipling tells it, which 
is hardly the style of a mechanical engineer. But suppose now the 
child had been confronted with the “story” of a planet as it emerges 
from the textbooks of celestial mechanics, and had been asked to 
calculate its orbits and perturbations. This would be a task for a 
joyless grownup, and a professional one at that. Who else could 
face the pages bristling with partial differential equations, with long 
series of approximations, with integrals contrived from pointless 
quadratures? Truly a world of reserved knowledge. But if, on the 
other hand, a person living several thousand years ago had been 
confronted with cunningly built tales of Saturn's reign, and of his 
exorbitant building and modeling activities—after he had “separated 
Heaven and Earth” by means of that fateful sickle, that is, after he 
had established the obliquity of the ecliptic ... If he had heard of 
Jupiter’s ways of command and his innumerable escapades, popu¬ 
lating the earth with gentle nymphs forever crossed in their quest 
for happiness, escapades that were invariably successful in spite of 
the constant watchfulness of his jealous “ox-eyed” or sometimes 
“dog-eyed” spouse ... If this person also learned of the fierce ad¬ 
ventures of Mars, and the complex mutual involvement of gods 




53 • History , Myth and Reality 

and heroes expressing themselves in terms of action and unvarying 
numbers, he would have been a participant in the process of mythi¬ 
cal knowledge. This knowledge would have been transmitted by 
his elders, confirmed by holy commands, rehearsed by symbolic 
experiences in the form of musical rites and performances involving 
his whole people. He would have found it easier to respect than 
comprehend, but it would have led to an idea of the overall texture 
of the cosmos. In his own person, he would have been part of a 
genuine theory of cosmology, one he had absorbed by heart, that 
was responsive to his emotions, and one that could act on his aspira¬ 
tions and dreams. This kind of participation in ultimate things, now 
extremely difficult for anyone who has not graduated in astro¬ 
physics, was then possible to some degree for everyone, and no¬ 
where could it be vulgarized. 

That is what is meant here by mythical knowledge. It was under¬ 
stood only by a very few, it appealed to many, and it is forever 
intractable for those who approach it through “mathematics for the 
million'’ or by speculations on the unconscious. In other words, 
this is a selective and difficult approach, employing the means at 
hand and much thought, limited surely, but resistant to falsifi¬ 
cation. 

How, in former times, essential knowledge was transmitted on 
two or more intellectual levels can be learned from Germaine 
Dieterlen's introduction to Marcel Griaule's Conversations veith 
Ogotevivieli , which deals with Dogon education and with the per¬ 
sonal experience of the members of La Mission Griaule , who had to 
wait sixteen years before the sage old men of the tribe decided to 
“open the door.’' 3 The description is revealing enough to be quoted 
in full: 

In African societies which have preserved their traditional organiza¬ 
tion the number of persons who are trained in this knowledge is 
quite considerable. This they call ‘‘deep knowledge" in contrast with 
“simple knowledge" which is regarded as “only a beginning in the 
understanding of beliefs and customs" that people who are not fully 
instructed in the cosmogony possess. There are various reasons for 
the silence that is generally observed on this subject. To a natural

’ 54 


reserve before strangers who, even when sympathetic, remain un¬ 
consciously imbued with a feeling of superiority, one must add the 
present situation of rapid change in African societies through con¬ 
tact with mechanization and the influence of school teaching. But 
among groups where tradition is still vigorous, this knowledge, which 
is expressly characterized as esoteric, is only secret in the following 
sense. It is in fact open to all who show a will to understand so long 
as, by their social position and moral conduct, they are judged worthy 
of it. Thus every family head, every priest, every grown-up person 
responsible for some small fraction of social life can, as part of the 
social group, acquire knowledge on condition that he has the pa¬ 
tience and, as the African phrase has it, “he comes to sit by the side 
of the competent elders” over the period and in the state of mind 
necessary. Then he will receive answers to all his questions, but it 
'will take years. Instruction begun in childhood during assemblies 
and rituals of the age-sets continues in fact throughout life. 

These various aspects of African civilization gradually became clear 
in the course of intensive studies undertaken among several of the 
peoples of Mali and Upper Volta over more than a decade. In the 
case of the Dogon, concerning whom there have already been nu¬ 
merous publications, these studies have made possible the elaboration 
of a synthesis covering the greater part of their activities. 

We should now record the important occurrence during the field 
expedition of 1947 which led to the writing of this particular study. 
From 1931 the Dogon had answered questions and commented on 
observations made during previous field trips on the basis of the in¬ 
terpretation of facts which they call “la parole de face”; this is the 
“simple knowledge” which they give in the first instance to all 
enquirers. Publications of information obtained before the studies in 
1948 relate to this first level of interpretation. 

But the Dogon came to recognize the great perseverance of Marcel 
Griaule and his team in their enquiries, and that it was becoming in¬ 
creasingly difficult to answer the multiplicity of questions without 
moving on to a different level. They appreciated our eagerness for 
an understanding which earlier explanations had certainly not satis¬ 
fied, and which was clearly more important to us than anything else. 
Griaule had also shown a constant interest in the daily life of the 
Dogon, appreciating their efforts to exploit a difficult country where 
there was a serious lack of water in the dry season, and our relation¬ 
ships, which had thus extended beyond those of ethnographical en¬ 
quiry, became more and more trusting and affectionate. In the light 
of all this, the Dogon took their own decision, of which we learned 
only later when they told us themselves. The elders of the lineages 







55 # History, Myth and Reality 

of the double village of Ogol and the most important totemic priests 
of the region of Sanga met together and decided that the more eso¬ 
teric aspects of their religion should be fully revealed to Professor 
Griaule. To begin this they chose one of their best informed mem¬ 
bers, Ogotommeli, who, as will be seen in the introduction, arranged 
the first interview. This first exposition lasted exactly the number of 
days recorded in Dien d'Ean , in which the meandering flow of in¬ 
formation is faithfully reported. Although we knew nothing of it at 
the time, the progress of this instruction by Ogotemmeli was being 
reported on daily to the council of elders and priests. 

The seriousness and importance of providing this expose of Dogon 
belief was all the greater because the Dogon elders knew perfectly 
well that in doing so they were opening the door, not merely to these 
thirty days of information, but to later and more intensive work 
which was to extend over months and years. They never withdrew 
from this decision, and we should like to express here our grateful 
thanks to them. After Ogotemmeli’s death, others carried on the 
work. And since Professor Griaule’s death they have continued with 
the same patience and eagerness to complete the task they had under¬ 
taken. These later enquiries have made possible the publication of the 
many further studies cited in the bibliography, and the preparation 
of a detailed treatise entitled Le Renard Pale , the first part of which 
is now in press. And in 1963, as this is written, the investigation still 
continues.

Tout-puissants etrangers, inevitables astres . . . 

Valery, La Jeune Parque 

This book is highly unconventional, and often the flow of the tales 
will be interrupted to put in words of guidance, in the fashion of 
the .Middle Ages, to emphasize salient points. 

To begin with, there is no system that can be presented in mod¬ 
ern analytical terms. There is no key, and there are no principles 
from which a presentation can be deduced. The structure comes 
from a time when there was no such thing as a system in our sense, 
and it would be unfair to search for one. There could hardly have 
been one among people who committed all their ideas to memory. 

It can be considered a pure structure of numbers. From the 
beginning we considered calling this essay “Art of the Fugue.” 
And that excludes any “world-picture,” a point that cannot be 
stressed strongly enough. Any effort to use a diagram is bound to 
lead into contradiction. It is a matter of times and rhythms. 

The subject has the nature of a hologram, something that has to 
be present as a whole to the mind. 1 Archaic thought is cosmological 
first and last; it faces the gravest implications of a cosmos in ways 
which reverberate in later classic philosophy. The chief implication 
is a profound awareness that the fabric of the cosmos is not only 
determined, but overdetermined and in a way that does not permit 
the simple location of any of its agents, whether simple magic or 


1 In optics, “hologram” is the interference pattern of light with itself; i.e., every 
part of an image is displayed at every point, as if every point looked at every 
source of light.

astrology, forces, gods, numbers, planetary powers, Platonic Forms, 
Aristotelian Essences or Stoic Substances. Physical reality here 
cannot be analytical in the Cartesian sense; it cannot be reduced 
to concreteness even if misplaced. Being is change, motion and 
rhythm, the irresistible circle of time, the incidence of the “right 
moment,” as determined by the skies. 

There are many events, described with appropriate terrestrial 
imagery, that do not, however, happen on earth. In this book there 
is mention of floods. In tradition, not one but three floods are 
registered, one being the biblical flood, equivalents of which are 
mentioned in Sumerian and Babylonian annals. The efforts of pious 
archaeologists to connect the biblical narrative with geophysical 
events are highly conjectural. There have been floods in .Mesopo¬ 
tamia causing grievous loss of life. There still are in the river plains 
of China and elsewhere, but none of the total nature that the Bible 
describes. 

There are tales, too, of cataclysmic deluges throughout the great 
continental masses, in Asia and America, told by peoples veho have 
never seen the sea, or lakes, or great rivers. The floods the Greeks 
described, like the flood of Deucalion, are as “mythical” as the 
narrative of Genesis. Greece is not submersible, unless by tsunamis. 
Deucalion and his wife landed on Mount Parnassus, high above 
Delphi, the “Navel of the Earth,” and were the only survivors of 
this flood, the second, sent by Zeus in order to destroy the men of 
one world-age. Classical authors disagreed on the specification of 
which world-age. Ovid voted for the Iron Age. Plato’s Solon keeps 
his conversation with the Egyptian priest on a mythical level, and 
his discussion of the two types of world destruction, by fire or 
water, is astronomical. 

The “floods” refer to an old astronomical image, based on an ab¬ 
stract geometry. That this is not an “easy picture” is not to be 
wondered at. considering the objective difficulty of the science of 
astronomy. But although a modern reader does not expect a text on 
celestial mechanics to read like a lullaby, he insists on his capacity 
to understand mythical “images” instantly, because he can respect 
as “scientific” only page-long approximation formulas, and the like.

He does not think of the possibility that equally relevant knowledge 
might once have been expressed in everyday language. He never 
suspects such a possibility, although the visible accomplishments of 
ancient cultures—to mention only the pyramids, or metallurgy— 
should be a cogent reason for concluding that serious and intelli¬ 
gent men were at work behind the stage, men who were bound to 
have used a technical terminology. 

Thus, archaic “imagery” is strictly verbal, representing a specific 
type of scientific language, which must not be taken at its face 
value nor accepted as expressing more or less childish “beliefs.” 
Cosmic phenomena and rules were articulated in the language, or 
terminology, of myth, where each key word was at least as “dark” 
as the equations and convergent series by means of which our 
modern scientific grammar is built up. To state it briefly, as we are 
going to do, is not to explain it—far from it. 

First, what was the “earth”? In the most general sense, the 
“earth” was the ideal plane laid through the ecliptic. The “dry 
earth,” in a more specific sense, was the ideal plane going through 
the celestial equator. The equator thus divided two halves of the 
zodiac which ran on the ecliptic, 2 3%° inclined to the equator, one 
half being “dry land” (the northern band of the zodiac, reaching 
from the vernal to the autumnal equinox), the other representing 
the “waters below” the equinoctial plane (the southern arc of the 
zodiac, reaching from the autumnal equinox, via the winter solstice, 
to the vernal equinox). The terms “vernal equinox,” “winter 
solstice,” etc., are used intentionally because myth deals with time, 
periods of time which correspond to angular measures, and not with 
tracts in space. 

This could be neglected were it not for the fact that the equi¬ 
noctial “points”—and therefore, the solstitial ones, too—do not re¬ 
main forever where they should in order to make celestial goings-on 
easier to understand, namely, at the same spot with respect to the 
sphere of the fixed stars. Instead, they stubbornly move along the 
ecliptic in the opposite direction to the yearly course of the sun, 
that is, against the “right” sequence of the zodiacal signs (Taurus-* 
Aries-»Pisces, instead of Pisces—>Aries->Taurus).

This phenomenon is called the Precession of the Equinoxes, and 
it was conceived as causing the rise and the cataclysmic fall of ages 
of the world. Its cause is a bad habit of the axis of our globe, which 
turns around in the manner of a spinning top, its tip being in the 
center of our small earth-ball, whence our earth axis, prolonged to 
the celestial North Pole, describes a circle around the North Pole 
of the ecliptic, the true “center'’ of the planetary system, the radius 
of this circle being of the same magnitude as the obliquity of the 
ecliptic with respect to the equator: 23^°. The time which this 
prolonged axis needs to circumscribe the ecliptical North Pole is 
roughly 26,000 years, during which period it points to one star after 
another: around 3000 B.c. the Pole star was alpha Draconis; at the 
time of the Greeks it was beta Ursae Minoris; for the time being it 
is alpha Ursae Minoris; in a.d. 14,000 it will be Vega. The equi¬ 
noxes, the points of intersection of ecliptic and equator, swinging 
from the spinning axis of the earth, move with the same speed of 
26,000 years along the ecliptic. 

The sun’s position among the constellations at the vernal equinox 
was the pointer that indicated the “hours” of the precessional cycle 
—very long hours indeed, the equinoctial sun occupying each zodi¬ 
acal constellation for about 2,200 years. The constellation that rose 
in the east just before the sun (that is, rose heliacally) marked the 
“place” where the sun rested. At this time it was known as the 
sun’s “carrier,” and as the main “pillar” of the sky, the vernal 
equinox being recognized as the fiducial point of the “system,” 
determining the first degree of the sun’s yearly circle, and the first 
day of the year. (When we say, it was “recognized,” we mean that 
it was spelled “carrier” or “pillar,” and the like: it must be kept in 
mind that we are dealing with a specific terminology, and not 
with vague and primitively rude “beliefs.”) At Time Zero (say, 
5000 b.c. —there are reasons for this approximate date), the sun 
was in Gemini; it moved ever so slowly from Gemini into Taurus, 
then Aries, then Pisces, which it still occupies and will for some 
centuries more. The advent of Christ the Fish marks our age. It was 
hailed by Virgil, shortly before Anno Domini: “a new great order 
of centuries is now being born . . .” which earned Virgil the 






Hamlet’s Mill • 60 


strange title of prophet of Christianity. The preceding age, that of 
Aries, had been heralded by Moses coming down from Mount Sinai 
as “two-horned,” that is, crowned with the Ram’s horns, while his 
flock disobediently insisted upon dancing around the “Golden 
Calf” that was, rather, a “Golden Bull,” Taurus. 

Thus, the revolving heavens gave the key, the events of our globe 
receding into insignificance. Attention was focused on the supernal 
presences, away from the phenomenal chaos around us. What 
moved in heaven of its own motion, the planets in their weeks and 
years, took on ever more awesome dignity. They were the Persons 
of True Becoming. The zodiac was where things really happened, 
for the planets, the true inhabitants, knew what they were doing, 
and mankind was only passive to their behest. It is revealing to look 
at the figure drawn by a West Sudanese Dogon at the request of 
Professor Zahan, showing the world egg, with the “inhabited world” 
between the tropics, “le cylindre ou rectangle du monde.” 2 The 
Dogon are fully aware of the fact that the region between the ter¬ 
restrial tropics is not the best of inhabitable quarters, and so were 
their teachers of far-off times, the archaic scientists who coined the 
terminology of myth. What counted was the zodiacal band be¬ 
tween the celestial tropics, delivering the houses, and the inns, the 
“masks” (prosopa), and the disguises to the much traveling and 
“shape-shifting” planets. 

How far this point of view was from modern indifference can 
hardly be appreciated except by those who can see the dimensions 
of the historical chasm that opened with the adoption of the Coper- 
nican doctrine. What had been for Sir Thomas Browne an o alti¬ 
tude) crowded with religious emotions, presences and presentiments 
has become a platitude that could at best inspire a Russian cosmo¬ 
naut with the triumphant observation: “I have been up in the sky, 
and nowhere did I find God.” Astronomy has come down into the 
realm of exterior ballistics, a subject for the adventures of the Space 
Patrol.

One might say that it takes a wrenching effort of the imagination 
to restore in us the capacity for wonder of an Aristotle. But it 
would be misleading to talk of “us” generally, because the average 
Babylonian or Greek showed as little inclination to wonder at order 
and law in nature as our average contemporaries do. It has been and 
will be the mark of a true scientific mind to search for, and to 
wonder at, the invariable structure of number behind the manifold 
appearances. (It needs the adequate “expectation,” the firm con¬ 
fidence in “sense —and “sense” does mean number and order for us, 
since the birth of high civilization—to discover the periodical sys¬ 
tem of the elements or, further on, Balmer’s series.) Whence it is 
much easier for a great scientist—for instance, Galileo, Kepler, or 
Newton—to appreciate master feats of early mathematicians than 
it is for the average humanist of all ages. No professional historian 
of culture is likely to understand better the intellectual frame of 
mind of the Maya than the astronomer Hans Ludendorff has done. 

It is not so much the enormous number of new facts established 
by scientists in the many centuries between antiquity and the 20th 
century which separates us from the outlook of our great scientific 
ancestors but the “deteriorated” expectations ruling our time. 
Kepler’s quest, were he living today, would be to discover a modi¬ 
fied perspective from which to rediscover the Harmonice Mundi 
on another scale. But, after all, what else if not such a quest for the 
establishment of a new kind of cosmos is the work on the “general 
field formula”- This time, the cosmos, as covered by the coming- 
to-be formula, will be understandable and will make “sense” only 
for the best mathematicians, to the complete exclusion of the com¬ 
mon people, and it will hardly be a “meaningful” universe such as 
the archaic one had been. 

To come back to the key words of ancient cosmology: if the 
words “flat earth” do not correspond in any way to the fancies of 
the flat-earth fanatics who still infest the fringes of our society 
and who in the guise of a few preacher-friars made life miserable 
for Columbus, so the name of “true earth” (or of “the inhabited 
world”) did not in any way denote our physical geoid for the

archaics. It applies to the band of the zodiac, two dozen degrees 
right and left of the ecliptic, to the tracks of the “true inhabitants” 
of this world, namely, the planets. It comprises their various oscilla¬ 
tions and curlicues from their courses, and also the “dragon,” well 
known from very early times, which causes eclipses by swallowing 
the sun and moon. 

On the zodiacal band, there are four essential points which domi¬ 
nate the four seasons of the year. They are, in fact, in church 
liturgy the quatuor tempora marked with special abstinences. They 
correspond to the two solstices and the two equinoxes. The solstice 
is the “turning back” of the sun at the lowest point of winter and at 
the highest point of summer. The two equinoxes, vernal and 
autumnal, are those that cut the year in half, with an equal balance 
of night and day, for they are the two intersections of the equator 
with the ecliptic. Those four points together made up the four 
pillars, or corners, of what was called the “quadrangular earth.” 

This is an essential feature that needs more attention. We have 
said above that “earth,” in the most general sense, meant the ideal 
plane laid through the ecliptic; meanwhile we are prepared to im¬ 
prove the definition: “earth” is the ideal plane going through the 
four points of the year, the equinoxes and the solstices. Since the 
four constellations rising heliacally at the two equinoxes and the 
two solstices determine and define an “earth,” it is termed quad¬ 
rangular (and by no means “believed” to be quadrangular by 
“primitive” Chinese, and so on). And since constellations rule the 
four corners of the quadrangular earth only temporarily, such an 
“earth” can rightly be said to perish, and a new earth to rise from 
the waters, with four new constellations rising at the four points of 
the year. Virgil says: “lam redit et Virgo .. .” (already the Virgin 
is returning). (It is important to remember the vernal equinox as the 
fiducial point; it is from this fact that a new earth is termed to rise 
from the waters. In reality, only the new vernal equinoctial con¬ 
stellation climbs from the sea onto the dry land above the equator 3 — 
the inverse happens diametrically opposite. A constellation that

ceases to mark the autumnal equinox, gliding below the equator, is 
drowned.) This “formula” will make it easier to understand the 
myth of Deucalion, in which the devastating waves of the flood 
were ordered back by Triton’s blowing the conch: the conch had 
been invented by Aigokeros, i.e., Capricornus, who ruled the win¬ 
ter solstice in the world-age when Aries “carried” the sun. 

At Time Zero, the two equinoctial “hinges” of the world had 
been Gemini and Sagittarius, spanning between them the arch of 
the Milky Way: both bicorporeal signs 4 —and so were Pisces, and 
Virgo with her ear of wheat, at the two other corners—to mark 
the idea that the way (the Milky Way itself) was open between 
earth and heaven, the way up and the way down where men and 
gods could meet in that Golden Age. As will be shown later, the 
exceptional virtue of the Golden Age was precisely that the cross¬ 
roads of ecliptic and equator coincided with the crossroads of 
ecliptic and Galaxy, namely in Gemini and Sagittarius, both con¬ 
stellations “standing” firmly at two of the four corners of the 
quadrangular earth. 

At the “top,” in the center high above the “dry” plane of the 
equator, was the Pole star. At the opposite top, or rather in the 
depth of the waters below, unobserved from our latitudes, was the 
southern pole, thought to be Canopus, by far the brightest star of 
these regions, more remarkable than the Southern Cross. 

This brief sketch of archaic theory indicates—to repeat—that 
geography in our sense was never meant, but a cosmography of the 
kind needed even now by navigators. Ptolemy, the great geogra¬ 
pher of antiquity, had been thinking of nothing else. His Geog¬ 
raphy is a set of coordinates drawn from the skies, and transferred 
onto an uncouth outline map of our globe, with a catalogue of 
earthly distances added on by sailors and travelers to pinpoint, or 
confirm, the positions of countries around the Mediterranean world. 
It was an uncouth outline map, for it covered only a few countries 
known around the Mediterranean region. Nothing was shown be¬ 
yond the latitude 16 0 south of the equator and 63° north, cor-

different from those given by Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos z.ii.

responding to Iceland. Nothing west beyond the Canary Islands or 
east of the easternmost city of China, an arc of longitude fixed for 
simplicity at 180°, twelve equinoctial hours from end to end, the 
breadth over the whole latitudes being nine equinoctial hours. A 
large part of the space is blank and the limits are assigned, as they 
should be, astronomically. This is what the ancients knew after a 
thousand years of exploration, and they handed it down to the 
Renaissance. They called it the oikoumene , the inhabited earth. 

One may well understand how the archaics gave this name for 
purely astronomical reasons to the zodiacal band, about as wide in 
degrees but embracing the whole globe. The world, the cosmos, 
was above, revolving majestically in twenty-four hours, and it lent 
itself to the passionate exploration of cosmographers through the 
starlit night. Astrology was the inevitable outcome of astronomy 
through those ages. The early Greeks derived their mathematics 
from astronomy. In those centuries, their insatiable curiosity de¬ 
veloped a knowledge of our earth and the events on it which drove 
them to create the beginnings of our science. But soon after Aris¬ 
totle, the Stoics reverted to the oriental pattern and reinstalled 
astrology. Three centuries of pre-Socratic thought had equipped 
them with an interest in physics, but with it they had nowhere to 
go. They still had no experimental science as we mean it. What 
they needed was an interpretation of influences, to go with the 
all-in-all that the cosmos has to be. Stoic physics was a seductive 
presentment of a field theory, but it was a counterfeit. Nothing 
was to come of it because the true implications of the archaic 
cosmos, no less than those of the Platonic, were incompatible with 
anything that our physics can think of. In Stoic physics there is no 
simple location, no analytical space. 

It should be understood once and for all that the gulf between 
the archaic world and ours was as wide as science itself. Prodigies 
of exactitude and computation could not bridge it. Only the astro¬ 
nomical map could. Whitehead has summed it up succinctly: “Our 
science has been founded on simple location and misplaced con¬ 
creteness.” Modern physics has turned the original words'into 



65 • A Guide for the Perplexed 

queries. For Newton, it had the force of evidence: “No person 
endowed with a capacity of rational understanding will believe that 
a thing acts where it is not.” Newton himself put the first query, 
by stating the theory of gravitation—mathematically irresistible, 
physically unexplainable. He could only accept it: “I do not under¬ 
stand it, and I am going to feign no suppositions.” The answer was 
to come only with Einstein. It amounted to pure mathematical 
rationalization, which did away with simple location, and with 
concreteness altogether. The edifice of Descartes lay in ruins. 
Nonetheless, the mind of civilized man clung to both principles 
invincibly, as being equal to common sense. It was a model case of 
habit having become second nature. The birth of experimental 
physics was a decisive factor in the change. 

No such common sense obtained once upon a time, when time 
was the only reality, and space had still to be discovered—or in¬ 
vented—by Parmenides after 500 b.c. (See G. de Santillana, “Pro¬ 
logue to Parmenides,” in Reflections on Men and Ideas [1968], pp. 
82-119.) 

The task then was to recover from the remote past an utterly 
lost science, linked to an equally lost culture—one in which an¬ 
thropologists have seen only illiterate “primitive man.” It was as if 
the legendary “Cathedrale Engloutie” emerged from the depth of 
prehistory with its bells still ringing. 

The problem was also clear: this lost science, immensely sophis¬ 
ticated, had no “system,” no systematic key that could be a basis 
for teaching. It existed before systems could be thought of. It was, 
to repeat, a spontaneously generated “Art of the Fugue.” That is 
why it took us so many years to work it out. 

The archaics’ vision of the universe appears to have left out all 
ideas of the earth suspended, or floating, in space. Whether or not 
this was really so cannot be decided yet: there are peculiar rumors 
to be heard about innumerable “Brahma-Eggs,” that is, spheres like 
our own, in India. The Maori of New Zealand claimed, as the 
Pythagoreans had done, that every star had mountains and plains, 
and was inhabited like the earth. Varahamihira (5th century a.d.) 






n 


Hamlet’s Mill • 66 

even stated that the earth was suspended between magnets. 5 For 
the time being, one must continue to assume that the earth was 
simply the center of the world, and a sphere, and that there was no 
trace of Galilean relativism which is so natural to us, posing so 
many problems of motion. The Greeks still had the old idea, but 
they asked themselves questions about it. What moved was the sky, 
but questions about the sky posed abstruse problems. The greatest 
one was, of course, the slow motion of the tilt of the sky, described 
above, which went through a Great Year of 26,000 years. 

The Greek astronomers had enough instrumentation and data to 
detect the motion, which is immensely slow, and they saw that it 
applied to the whole of the sky. Hipparchus in 127 b . c . called it 
the Precession of the Equinoxes. There is good reason to assume 
that he actually rediscovered this, that it had been known some 
thousand years previously, and that on it the Archaic Age based its 
long-range computation of time. Modern archaeological scholars 
have been singularly obtuse about the idea because they have cul¬ 
tivated a pristine ignorance of astronomical thought, some of them 
actually ignorant of the Precession itself. The split between the two 
cultures begins right here. But apart from this, although the schol¬ 
ars unanimously cling to the accepted conventions about the tempo 
of historical evolution, they widely disagree when it comes to 
judging the evidence in detail. The verdicts concerning the famil¬ 
iarity of ancient Near Eastern astronomers with the Precession 
depend, indeed, on arbitrary factors: namely, on the different 
scholarly opinions about the difficulty of the task. Ernst Dittrich, 
for instance, remarked that one should not expect much astronomi¬ 
cal knowledge from Mesopotamians around 2000 b . c . “Probably 
they knew only superficially the geometry of the motions of sun 
and moon. Thus, if we examine the simple, easily observable mo¬ 
tions by means of which one could work out chronological deter¬ 
minants with very little mathematical knowledge, we find only the 

5 Pancasiddhantika, chapter XII (Thibaut trans., p. 69): “The round ball of the

sphere, like a piece of iron suspended between magnets.”

Precession. There was also a learned Italian Church dignitary, 
Domenico Testa, who snatched at this curious argument to prove 
that the world had been created ex nihilo, as described in the first 
book of Moses, an event that supposedly happened around 4000 
b.c. If the Egyptians had had a background of many millennia to 
reckon with, who, he asked, could have been unaware of the Pre¬ 
cession- “The very sweepers of their observatories would have 
known.” 6 7 Hence tune could not have begun before 4000, Q.E.D. 

The comparison of the views just quoted with those upheld by 
the majority of modem scholars shows that one's own subjective 
opinions about what is easy and what is difficult might not be the 
most secure basis for a serious historiography of science. As Hans 
Ludendorff once pointed out, it is an unsound approach to Maya 
astronomy to start from preconceived convictions about what the 
Maya could have known and what they could not possibly have 
known: one should, instead, draw conclusions only from the data 
as given in the inscriptions and codices. s That this had to be stressed 
explicitly reveals the steady decline of scientific ethics. 

We today are aware of the Precession as the gentle tilting of our 
globe, an irrelevant one at that. As the GI said, lost in the depth of 
jungle misery, when his friends took refuge in their daydreams: 
“When I close my eyes, I see only a mule's behind. Also when I 
don't.'' This is. as it were, today's vision of reality. Today, the Pre¬ 
cession is a well-established fact. The space-time continuum does 
not affect it. It is by now only a boring complication. It has lost 
relevance for our affairs, whereas once it was the only majestic 
secular motion that our ancestors could keep in mind when they 
looked for a great cycle which could affect humanity as a whole. 
But then our ancestors M ere astronomers and astrologers. They 
believed that the sliding of the sun along the equinoctial point af¬ 
fected the frame of the cosmos and determined a succession of

world-ages under different zodiacal signs. They had found a large 
peg on which to hang their thoughts about cosmic time, which 
brought all things in fateful order. Today, that order has lapsed, 
like the idea of the cosmos itself. There is only history, which has 
been felicitously defined as “one damn thing after another.” 

And yet, were history really understood in this admittedly flat 
sense of things happening one after another to the same stock of 
people, we should be better off than we are now, when we almost 
dare not admit the assumption from which this book starts, that our 
ancestors of the high and far-off times were endowed with minds 
wholly comparable to ours, and were capable of rational processes 
—always given the means at hand. It is enough to say that this flies 
in the face of a custom which has become already a second nature. 

Our period may some day be called the Darwinian period, just as 
we talk of the Newtonian period of two centuries ago. The simple 
idea of evolution, which it is no longer thought necessary to ex¬ 
amine, spreads like a tent over all those ages that lead from primitiv¬ 
ism into civilization. Gradually, we are told, step by step, men 
produced the arts and crafts, this and that, until they emerged into 
the light of history. 

Those soporific words “gradually” and “step by step,” repeated 
incessantly, are aimed at covering an ignorance which is both vast 
and surprising. One should like to inquire: which steps? But then 
one is lulled, overwhelmed and stupefied by the gradualness of it 
all, which is at best a platitude, only good for pacifying the mind, 
since no one is willing to imagine that civilization appeared in a 
thunderclap. 

One could find a key in a brilliant TV production on the Stone¬ 
henge problem given a few years ago. With the resources of the 
puissant techniques of ubiquity, various authorities were called to 
the screen to discuss the possible meaning of the astronomical align¬ 
ments and polygons discovered in the ancient Megalith since 1906, 
when Sir Norman Lockyer, the famous astronomer, published the 
results of his first investigation. Specialists, from prehistorians to 
astronomers, expressed their doubts and wonderments down to the 
last one, a distinguished archaeologist who had been working on

the monument itself for many years. He had more fundamental 
doubts. How could one not realize, he said, that the builders of 
Stonehenge were barbarians, “howling barbarians” who were, to 
say the least, utterly incapable of working out complex astronomi¬ 
cal cycles and over many years at that? The uncertain coincidences 
must be due to chance. And then, with perverse irony, the mid¬ 
winter sun of the solstice appeared on the screen rising exactly be¬ 
hind the Heel Stone, as predicted. The “mere” coincidences had 
been in fact ruled out, since Gerald Hawkins, a young astronomer 
unconcerned with historical problems, had run the positions 
through a computer and discovered more alignments than had been 
dreamed of. Here was the whole paradox. Howling barbarians 
who painted their faces blue must have known more astronomy 
than their customs and table manners could have warranted. The 
lazy word “evolution” had blinded us to the real complexities of 
the past. 

That key term “gradualness” should be understood to apply to a 
vastly different time scale than that considered by the history of 
mankind. Human history taken as a whole in that frame, even ra- 
ciation itself, is only an evolutionary episode. In that whole, Cro- 
Magnon man is the last link. All of protohistory is a last-minute 
flickering. 

But while the biologists were wondering, something great had 
come upon the scene, arriving from unexpected quarters. Sir James 
George Frazer was a highly respected classical scholar who, while 
editing the Description of Greece by Pausanias, was impressed with 
the number of beliefs, practices, cults and superstitions spread over 
the classical landscape of Greece in classical times. This led him to 
search deeper into the half-forgotten strata of history, and out of 
it came his Golden Bough. The historian had turned ethnologist, 
and extended his investigations to the whole globe. Suddenly, an 
immense amount of material became available about fertility cults 
as the universal form of earliest religion, and about primitive magic 
connected with it. This appeared to be the humus from which 
civilization had grown—simple deities of the seasons, a dim multi¬ 
tude of peasants copulating in the furrows and building up rituals

of fertility with human sacrifice. Added to this, in political circles, 
there came the vision of war as both inherent in human nature and 
ennobling—the law of natural selection applied to nations and 
races. Thus, many materials and much history went to build the 
temple of evolutionism. But as the theory moved on, its high- 
minded aspects began to wane; psychoanalysis moved in as a tidal 
wave. For if the struggle for life (and the religions of the life force) 
can explain so much, the unconscious can explain anything. As we 
know today only too well. 

The universal and uniform concept of gradualness thus defeated 
itself. Those key words (gradualness and evolution) come from the 
earth sciences in the first place, where they had a precise meaning. 
Crystallization and upthrust, erosion and geosynclinals are the re¬ 
sult of forces acting constantly in accordance with physical laws. 
They provided the backdrop for Darwin’s great scenario. When it 
comes to the evolution of life, the terms become less precise in 
meaning, though still acceptable. Genetics and natural selection 
stand for natural law, and events are determined by the rolling of 
the dice over long ages. But we cannot say much about the why 
and the how of this instead of that specific form, about where spe¬ 
cies, types, cultures branched off. Animal evolution remains an 
overall historical hypothesis supported by sufficient data—and by 
the lack of any alternative. In detail, it raises an appalling number 
of questions to which we have no answer. Our ignorance remains 
vast, but it is not surprising. 

And then we come to history, and the evolutionary idea reap¬ 
pears, coming in as something natural, with all scale lost. The 
accretion of plausible ideas goes on, its flow invisibly carried by 
“natural law” since the time of Spencer. It all remains within an 
unexamined kind of Naturphilosophie. For if we stopped to think, 
we would agree that as far as human “fate” is concerned organic 
evolution ceased before the time when history, or even prehistory, 
began. We are on another time scale. This is no longer nature act¬ 
ing on man, but man on nature. People like to think of a constancy 
of laws which apply to us. But man is a law unto himself.

When, riding on the surf of the general “evolutionism,” Ernst 
Haeckel and his faithful followers proposed to solve the “world 
riddles” once and for all, Rudolf Virchow 9 warned time and again 
of an evil “monkey wind” blowing round; he reminded his col¬ 
leagues of the index of excavated “prehistoric” skulls and pointed 
to the unchanged quantity of brain owned by the species Homo 
sapiens. But his contemporaries paid no heed to his admonitions; 
least of all the humanists who applied, without blinking, the strictly 
biological scheme of the evolution of organisms to the cultural 
history of the single species Homo sapiens. 

In later centuries historians may declare all of us insane, because 
this incredible blunder was not detected at once and was not re¬ 
futed with adequate determination. Mistaking cultural history for 
a process of gradual evolution, we have deprived ourselves of every 
reasonable insight into the nature of culture. It goes without saying 
that the still more modern habit of replacing “culture” by “society” 
has blocked the last narrow path to understanding history. Our 
ignorance not only remained vast, but became pretentious as well. 

A glimpse at some Pensees might show the abyss that yawns 
between us and a serious thinker of those golden days before the 
outbreak of “evolution.” This is what Pascal asked: “What are our 
natural principles but principles of custom? In children they are 
those which they have received from the habits of their fathers, as 
hunting in animals. A different custom will cause different natural 
principles.” And: “Custom is a second nature which destroys the 
former. But what is nature? For is custom not natural? I am much 
afraid that nature is itself only a first custom, as custom is a second 
nature.” 10 

This kind of question, aimed with precision at the true problem¬ 
atical spots, would have been enough to make hash of social an¬ 
thropology two centuries ago, and also of anthropological sociol¬ 
ogy. Although fully aware of the knot of frightening problems

arising from the results of the most modern neurophysiology—the 
building up of microneurons in the brain after birth, etc.—we are 
by no means entitled to feign any hypotheses beyond saying that 
the master brain who will, sooner or later, fashion a new philo¬ 
sophical anthropology deserving the title, one that will account for 
all the new implications, will find himself up against these same few 
questions of Pascal. 

Some words have still to be said about the problem that is at the 
very root of the many misunderstandings, that of translation. Most 
of the texts were written—if they were ever originally written— 
in remote and half-obliterated languages from the far past. The 
task of translation has been taken over by a guild of dedicated, 
highly specialized philologists who have had to reconstruct the dic¬ 
tionaries and grammars of these languages. It would be bad grace 
to dismiss their efforts, but one must take into account several layers 
of error: (1) personal or systematic errors, arising from their pre¬ 
conceptions and from well-implanted prejudices (psychological 
and philosophical) of their age; (2) the very structure of our own 
language, of the architecture of our own verbal system, of which 
very few individuals are aware. There was once a splendid article 
by Erwin Schroedinger, with the title “Are there quantum jumps?” 
which laid bare many such misunderstandings inside the well- 
worked area of modern physics. 11 And all this ties up with another 
major source of error that comes from the underestimation of the 
thinkers of the far past. We instinctively dismiss the idea that five 
to ten thousand years ago there may very well have been thinkers 
of the order of Kepler, Gauss, or Einstein, working with the means 
at hand. 

In other words, we must take language seriously. Imprecise lan¬ 
guage discloses the lack of precision of thought. We have learned to 
take the language of Archimedes or Eudoxos seriously, simply be¬ 
cause it can translate directly into modern forms of thought. This 
should extend to forms of thought utterly different from ours in 
appearance. Take that great endeavor on the hieroglyphic language,

embodied in the imposing Egyptian dictionary of Erman-Grapow. 
For our simple word “heaven” it shows thirty-seven terms whose 
nuances are left to the translator and used according to his lights. 
So the elaborate instructions in the Book of the Dead, referring to 
the soul’s celestial voyage, translate into “mystical” talk, and must 
be treated as holy mumbo jumbo. But then, modern translators be¬ 
lieve so firmly in their own invention, according to which the 
underworld has to be looked for in the interior of our globe—in¬ 
stead of in the sky—that even 370 specific astronomical terms 
would not cause them to stumble. 

One small example may indicate the way in which texts are “im¬ 
proved.” In the inscriptions of Dendera, published by Diimichen, 
the goddess Hathor is called “lady of every joy.” For once, Diimi- 
chen adds: “Literally . . . ‘the lady of every heart circuit.’ ” 12 
This is not to say that the Egyptians had discovered the circulation 
of the blood. But the determinative sign for “heart” often figures 
as the plumb bob at the end of a plumb line coming from a well- 
known astronomical or surveying device, the merkhet. Evidently, 
“heart” is something very specific, as it were the “center of grav¬ 
ity.” 13 And this may lead in quite another direction. The Arabs 
preserved a name for Canopus—besides calling the star Kalb at-tai- 
man (“heart of the south”): 14 Suhail el-wezn, “Canopus Pondero- 
sus,” the heavy-weighing Canopus, a name promptly declared 
meaningless by the experts, but which could well have belonged to 
an archaic system in which Canopus was the weight at the end of 
the plumb line, as befitted its important position as a heavy star at 
the South Pole of the “waters below.” Here is a chain of inferences 
which might or might not be valid, but it is allowable to test it, 
and no inference at all would come from the “lady of every 
joy.” The line seems to state that Hathor (= Hat Hor, “House of 
Horus”) “rules” the revolution of a specific celestial body— 
whether or not Canopus is alluded to—or, if we can trust the trans-

lation “every,” the revolution of all celestial bodies. As concerns the 
identity of the ruling lady, the greater possibility speaks for Sirius, 
but Venus cannot be excluded; in Mexico, too, Venus is called 
“heart of the earth.” The reader is invited to imagine for himself 
what many thousands of such pseudo-primitive or poetic interpre¬ 
tations must lead to: a disfigured interpretation of Egyptian in¬ 
tellectual life. 

The problem of astrology —The greatest gap between archaic 
thinking and modern thinking is in the use of astrology. By this is 
not meant the common or judicial astrology which has become 
once again a fad and a fashion among the ignorant public, an escape 
from official science, and for the vulgar another kind of black art 
of vast prestige but with principles equally uncomprehended. It is 
necessary to go back to archaic times, to a universe totally unsus¬ 
pecting of our science and of the experimental method on which it 
is founded, unaware of the awful art of separation which distin¬ 
guishes the verifiable from the unverifiable. This was a time, rich 
in another knowledge which was later lost, that searched for other 
principles. It gave the lingua franca of the past. Its knowledge was 
of cosmic correspondences, which found their proof and seal of 
truth in a specific determinism, nay overdeterminism, subject to 
forces completely without locality. The fascination and rigor of 
Number made it mandatory that the correspondences be exact in 
many forms (Kepler in this sense is the last Archaic). The multi¬ 
plicity of relations seen or intuited brought the idea to a focus in 
which the universe appeared determined not on one but on many 
levels at once. This was the signature of “panmathematizing idea¬ 
tion.” This idea may well have led up to a pre-established harmony 
on an infinite number of levels. Leibniz has shown us how far 
it could go, given modern tools: the universe conceived all at once, 
complete with its individual destinies for all time, out of an “efful- 
guration” of the divine mind. Some prehistoric or protohistoric Py¬ 
thagorean Leibniz, whose existence is far from inconceivable, may 
well have cherished this impossible dream, going to the limit more 
innocently than our own historic sage. Starting from the power of

Number, a whole logic is thinkable in this view. Fata regunt orbem, 
certa stant omnia lege. 

The only thinker of Antiquity who could be proof against this 
temptation was Aristotle, for he thought that forms were only 
potential in the beginning, and came into actualization only in the 
course of their lifetime, thus undergoing their fate as individuals. 
But that is because Aristotle refused mathematics from the start. 
He had the grounds for opposing universal synchronicity (the word 
and the idea were invented by C. G. Jung, replacing space with 
time, which goes to show that the archaic scheme has more lives 
than a cat). 

Yet, here again. Dante comes to the fore as a witness; for, by art 
of Gramarye, as the simple used to say. he spans the whole itinerary, 
or shall we say the cheminement de la pensee, between two world 
epochs. An Aristotelian to the core, steeped in the discipline of 
Thomism. hence by inheritance anti-mathematical, his spirit in its 
sweep understands the stars, in the sense of their Pythagorean im¬ 
plications. In his ascent to the realm of heaven, he encounters his 
friend and onetime companion of his wanton and romantic youth. 
Charles Martel ( Paradiso , vm.34-37), who tells him what it means 
to be of the elect: “We circle in one orbit, at one pace, with one 
thirst, along with the heavenly Princes whom thou didst once ad¬ 
dress from the world —“You M ho by Understanding Move the 
Third Heaven.” This is one of his early poems, a celebrated one 
at that, and it relates to the heavenly intelligences in a spirit of 
unrestrained Platonic worship. The progress of his song through 
the three realms will show him more and more wrapped in Platonic 
harmonies, much as he had dreamed of in his youth, and it will 
actually confirm his belief in astrology as a divine grant which keeps 
nature in order. Thus, the requirements of both doctrines have been 
saved: the arrangement of nature by genus and species (Aristotle) 
and the free development of one's own self (Aquinas) in a kind of 
Plotinian compromise overshadowed by the “Harmony of the 
Spheres.” Such was Dante's own inimitable “art of Gramarye.
