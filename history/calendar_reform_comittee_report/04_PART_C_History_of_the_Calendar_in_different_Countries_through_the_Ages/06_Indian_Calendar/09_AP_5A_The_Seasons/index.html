<p>correctly. It is now known that they all used the gnomon. Measures of the length of the different seasons and of the year by some of their eminent astronomers are given in the table (No. 30) below.</p>
<p>The Chaldeans must have also measured the length: of the year by the same method, either somewhat earlier or simultaneously with the early Greeks, but their names, excepting those of a few have not survived. But if in reality, the nineteen-year cycle was of as early as 747 B.C., they must have arrived at &amp; correct length of the year much earlier than any other nation.</p>
<p>The Length of the Seasons : The lengths of geasons were found exactly in the same way as in the case of the year, e.g., in the case of Spring, by counting the number of days from the day next to the vernal equinox day to the summer solstice day. The number would be variable from year to year, but a correct value was found by taking the observations for a number of years and taking the mean. The lengths obtained by early astronomers &amp;re :</p>
<p>the sun orossed the summer solstice (Juno 22), as is evident from the lines in Kalidasa&rsquo;s Meghadata or Cloud-Mogbangor.</p>
<p>Pratyāsanne Nabhasi dayitājivitā lambanarthi</p>
<p>Jimūtona svakuśalamayim hārayi yan pravsttim. Iranslation : When the month of Nabhas was imminent, ( just marking the onset of mongoop ), etc.&rdquo; Or in the Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyākānda</p>
<p>Udaggatvā-abhyupābśtte paretācaritām disam</p>
<p>A brávānā diśaḥ sarvāḥ snigdhā dadfáire ghandh. Translation : When the sun just reversed&rsquo;its motion after going (continuously) to the north, and began to proceed in the direction inhabited by departed souls (dakṣipāyana), the whole sky was overcast with clouds (i.o., the monsoon set in) ;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>. Winter solstice get in with the month of Tapas, which means penance. The winter solstice as mentioned above was the time from which the yearly sacrifices started.</p>
<p>The month names in the last column of table (No. 29) are ‘lunar', bụt they were linked to the solar months. They are now in universal use all over India to donote solar as well as lunar months ; but the two varieties are distinguished by the adjectives &lsquo;Solar&rsquo; or &lsquo;Lunar&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Both the European and Indian definitions of seasons are scientific as they are based on the cardinal days. The difference in nomenclature is trivial.</p>
<p>Table 30. Spring Summer Autumn Winter Total</p>
<p>days days d aye days days Chaldean &hellip; 94.50 92.73 88.59 .89.44 365.26 Euctemon (432 B.C.) 93 00</p>
<p>90 .92 365 Calippos (370 B.C.)': 94 - 92. 89 90 365 Correct values</p>
<p>for 1384 B.C. &hellip; 94.09 91.29 88.58 91.29 365.25</p>
<p>The ancients early discovered that the seasons were of unequal length, but they were ignorant of the physical reasons. These exact definitions of seasons, both in India and in the West, were arrived at very early, and are very important for accurate calendar-making ; but the true meaning of those definitions were forgotten in the succeed ing periods in India.</p>
<p>In Europoan astronomy, which is derived from Graeco Chaldean astronomy, we have :</p>
<p>Spring 0° - 90° from V.E, to 8.8. Summer 90°-180° .8. to ANE. Autumn 180°—270° A.E. to W.8.</p>
<p>Winter 270°—360° • W.8. to V.E. According to this scheme, the Rainy season consisting of months of Nabhas and Nabhasya formally set in when</p>
<p>The Length of the Year : The length of the year, as mentioned earlier, must have been found by counting the number of days from one equinox to another, or one solstice &lsquo;to another.</p>
<p>In actual practice, the number of days of the year, counted in this way would vary between 365 and 366. In the early stages, the length of the year was whole-numbered, but Indians of Vedāng&amp; Jyōtiṣa period had a year of: 366 days. Later when they came to a rigorous definition of the year, they realized that the number of days was not whole, but involved fractions.. Probably the attempt at determin ing the exact length of the year involving fractional numbers was obtained by adding up the lengths for &amp; number of years, and taking the mean.</p>
