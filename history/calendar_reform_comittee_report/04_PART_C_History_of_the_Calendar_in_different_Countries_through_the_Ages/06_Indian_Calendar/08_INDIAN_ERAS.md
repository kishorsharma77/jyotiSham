REPORT OF THE CALENDAR REFORM COMMITEE 

The apparent antiquity of certain eras, ė.g., the Kaliyuga or the Saptarsi, are however rather deceptive," for these eras are not mentioned either in the Vedic literature or even in the Mahābhārata ( a work of the 4th to 2nd century B.C.). The best proof, however, that no eras were used in date-recording in ancient India is obtained from "Inscriptions" which give 'con temporary evidence of the method of date-recording in use at the time when the inscription was composed. 

In India, the oldest inscriptions so far discovered and deciphered satisfactorily are those of the Emperor Asoka (273 to 227 B.C.); for the earlier Indus valley seal recordings have not yet been deciphered and no inscriptions or seals which can be referred to the time period between 2500 B.C. (time of Indus valley civili zation) and 250 B.C. ( time of Asoka ) have yet been brought to light. Asoka mentions in his inscriptions only the number of years elapsed since his coronation. No month, week-day or the serial number of the day in the month is mentioned. A typical Asokan ins cription giving time references is given in § 5.5. 

Continuous eras first began to be used in the re cords of the Indo-Scythian kings who reigned in modern Afghanistan and North-Western India beta ween 100 B.C. to 100 A.D. 

What is then the origin of the Kaliyuga or Saptarsi era given in Table 27 which go back to thousands of years before Christ? We are going to show presently that they are extrapolated eras invented much later than the alleged starting year. 

It is clear from historical records that date-recor ding by an era in India started from the time of the Kuṣana emperors and śaka satraps of Ujjain. But India cannot be singled out in this respect, for none of the great nations of antiquity, vix., Egypt, Babylon, Assyria or later Greece and Rome, used a continuously running era till rather late in their history. The introduction of the era is connected with the develop ment of the sense of 'History' which came rather late to all civilized nations. 

centuries in the total period of the cycle. Each cen tury is named after a naksatra, viz., Afrint, bharaṇī, etc ; and the number of years within the century is generally mentioned, so that the number of year of the era never exceeds 100. This era was in use in Kashmir and neighbouring places. In fact this era has no relation with the seven Rsis (the Great Bear) in the sky or with any actual naksatra division. There is difference of opinion as to the beginning of the era. According to Vrddha Garga and the Puranas the. starting year of the tenth century named after Magha are 3177 B.C., 477 B.C. and 2224 A.D. of the different cycles, when according to Varahamihira the third century named Krttikā begins. The beginning years of Varahamihira's Magha century of the different cycles are however 2477 B. C., 224 A. D. and 2924 A.D. 

The Pandava Kala or the Yudhisthira era started from 2449 B.C. according to Varahamihira. 

The so-called Yudhisthira era (2449 B.C.) is given by Kalhana, chronicler of Kashmir (1150 A.D.), who quotes the date from VỊddha Garga, an astronomer whose time is unknown. This era also does not occur in any inscription or any ancient treatise prior to Kalhana (1150 A.D.). Prof. M. N. Saha has shown that in the Mahābhārata the Krttikās are in many places taken as the first of the nakṣatras and are very nearly coincident with the vernal equinox. If we calculate the date of the M.Bh. incidents on this basis, the date comes out to be very nearly 2449 B.C. - 

It, however, niether proves that the incidents mentioned in the M.Bh., if they were actual occurrences, took place in 2449 B.C., for the epic was, not certainly put to writing before 400 B.C. as we know from a verse already mentioned on p. 226. It is inconceiveable to think that the dates could be remembered correctly for over 2000 years, when writing was in a very primitive state. The astro nomical references in the battle scenes, from which certain writers very laboriously deduce the date of these occurrences, are most probably later interpola tions, on the supposition that the incidents occurred about 2449 B.C. There is no inscriptional record regarding the use of Yudhiṣthira era or Pandavakāla.

Critical Examination of Indian Eras 

Here we are examining critically the claims of a few eras, which was supposed to date much earlier, e.g., the Kaliyuga era whico is commonly believed to have been introduced in 3102 B.C., the Saptarsi era, and the Pandara-Kala mentioned by Kalhana, the historian of Kashmir, who wrote in 1150 A.D., and supposed to be dating from 2449 B.C., and others. 

The Saptarsi era commoly known as Lokakalá or Laukika Kala is measured by centuries and has 27 sach 

(a) The Kaliyuga Era 

· It is easy to show that the Kaliyuga era which purports to date from 3102 B.C. is really an extra polated: era just like the Christian era, introduced long long after the supposed year of its beginning. 

It is first mentioned by Aiyabbata, the great i stronomer of ancient Påtaliputra, who says that'.3600 

INDIAN QALENDAR 

years of the Kaliyuga had passed .when he was 23 years old which is śaka year 421 (499 A. D.). It is not mentioned earlier either in books or in inscriptions. 

The first mention of this era in an inscription is found in the year 634-35 A.D., the inscription being that of king Pulakesin II of the Calukya. dynasty of Badam!, or somewhat earlier in a Jain treatise. It was most probably an era invented on astrological grounds just like the era of Nabonassar, by Aryabhaṭa or some other astropomer, who felt that the great antiquity of Indian civilization could not be described by the eras then in use (śaka, Chedi or Gupta era), as they were too recent. 

What were these astrological grounds ? The astrological grounds were that at the beginning of the Kaliyuga, the sun, the moon and the planets were in one zodiacal sign near the fixed Siddhāntic Meṣadi which according to some authorities is Ś Piscium, but according to others is 180° from Citrā or α Virginis. This was probably a back calculation based on the then prevailing knowledge of planetary motion, but has now been found to be totally wrong, when recalculated with the aid of more accurate modern data on planetary motion. We quote from 

Ancient Indian Chronology, pp. 35-39 by Prof. P. C. Sengupta, who has given a full exposition of Burgess's views on this point, with recalculations of his own. 

should also be a total eclipse of the Sun ; but no such things happened at that time. The beginning of the Kaliyuga was the midnight at Ujjayini terminating the 17th February of 9102 B.O., &ccording to Sūrya Siddhānta and the ārdharātrika system of Aryabhaṭa's astronomy as described in the Khandakhādyaka of Brahmagupta. Again this Kaliyuga is said to have begun, according to the Aryabhaṭīya from the sunrise at Lankā (supposed to be on the equator and on the same meridian with Ujjain)—from the mean sunrise on the 18th Feb., 3102 B.O. . 

Now astronomical events of the type described above and more specially the conjunction of the sun and the moon 

cannot happen both at midnight and at the next mean : sunrise. This shows that this Kaliyuga had an upreal 

beginning. . The researches of Bailey, Bentley and Burgess have : shown that a conjunction of all the 'planets' did not happen at the beginning of this Kaliyuga. Burgess rightly observes : 'It seems hardly to admit of a doubt that the epoch (the beginning of the astronomical Kaliyuga) was arrived at by astronomical calculation carried backward. 

We also can corroborate the findings of above research e rs in the following way and by using the most up-to-date 

equations for the planetary mean elements. 

Now the procession of the equinoxes from 3102 B. C. to 499 A.D. or Aryabhaṭa's time works out to have been = 49° 32' 39". The mean planetary elements at the beginning of the Kaliyuga, i.e., 17th Feb., 3102 B.C., Ujjayini mean time 24 hours, are worked out and shown below. We have

"Astronomical Kaliyuga an Astronomical Fiction" 

At the beginning of the astronomical Kaliyuga, all the mean places of the planets, viz., the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and tuturn, are taken to have been in conjunction at the beginning of the Hindu sphere, the moon's apogee and her ascending node at respectively a quarter circle and a half circle ahead of the same intial point. Under such a conjunction of all the planets, there 

added 49° 32' 39" to these mean tropical longitudes arrived at from the rules used, so as to get the longitudes measured from the vernal equinox of Aryabhạta's time. 

Hence we see that the assumed positions of the mean planets at the beginning of the astronomical Kaliyugá were really incorrect and the assumption was not a reality. But of what use this assumption was in Aryabhaṭa's time, i.e., 499 A.D., is now set forth below.' 

254 

Aryabhaṭa says that when he was 23 years old, 3600 years of. Kali bad elapsed. According to his Ārdharātrika system: 

3600 years - 1/1200 of a Mahāyuga=1314931.5 days. Again according to his Audayika system :. 

3600 years=1/1200 of a Mabāyuga=1314931.25 days. 

Honce according to both these systems of astronomy of Aryabhaṭa, by counting 3600 years from the beginning of the astronomical Kali epoch, we arrive at the date March 21, 499 A.D., Ujjayini mean time, 12 noon. The unreality of the Kali epoch is also evident from this finding. However, the position of mean planets at this time work out an given in table 26 below. 

about 57 B. C. Moreover a critical examination of inscriptions show the following details about this era. 

The earliest mention of this era, where it is definitely connected with the name of king Vikrakoso ditya is found in an inscription of one king Jaikadeva who ruled near Okhamandal in the Kathiawar Statêi The year mentioned is 794 of Vikrama era, i.e., 737 A.D.' In a subsequent inscription, dated 795 V.E. it : is also called the era of the lords of Malava. So the Vikrama era and the era of Malava lords are one and the same. Tracing back, we find the Malavagana era in use by a family of kings reigning at Mandasor, Rajputana between the years 461-589 V.E., as feuda

INDIAN CALENDAR 

Rajasthan, conquered the city of Kanauj about 828 A.D., they brought the Vikrama era from their original home, and it became the current era all over northern India except the eastern region, and was used by all Rajput dynasties of medieval times. . 

The months of the Vikrama era are all lunar, and the first month is Caitra. The months begin after the full-moon but the year begins 15 days after the full moon of Phalguna, i.e. after the new-moon of Caitra. But for astronomical calculations, it is pegged on to a solar year, which starts on the first of solar Vaisakha, theoretically the day after the vernal equinox. The Vikrama era is current also in parts of Gujrat, but there the year begins in Kārtika and the months are amānta, which corresponds to the Macedonian month of Dios, and the epoch is just six months later. Thus the western and northern varieties of the Vikrama era follow respectively the Macedonian and Babylonian reckonings (see § 3.3), the year of starting is 255 years later than that of the Seleucidean era. 

The conclusion is that the champions of the Vikrama era have still to prove the existence of king Vikrama of Ujjain. Early inscriptions show that the method of date-retording is not typically Indian as in the Satavahana inscriptions but follow the śaka-Kuṣāṇa method, which follows the contemporary . Graeco Chaldean method. It was therefore a foreign recko ning introduced either by the Greeks or Sakas, or an Indian prince or tribe who had imbibed some Graeco-Chaldean culture, but was adopted by the Malava tribes who migrated from the Punjab to Rajas than about the first century B.C. . The association with a king Vikrama occured 800 years later, and is probably due to lapse of historical memory, for the only historical king Vikramaditya who is known to have crushed the śaka power in Ujjain, was king Candragupta II of the Gupta dynasty (about 395 A.D.). Before this, the śaka dynasty in Ujjain had reigned almost in unbroken sequence from about 100 A.D. to 395 A.D., and had used an era of their own, later known as the "śaka' era. All the Gupta emperors from Samudragupta, had an "Aditya" title, and many of them had the title "Vikramaditya" so that the Gupta age was par excellence the age of Vikramadityas. But all the Gupta emperors use in their inscriptions the family era called the Guptakala which commemorated the foundation of Gupta empire (319 A.B). The association of the Malava era with king Vikramaditya, and assignment of king Vikramaditya to Ujjain, was due to confusion of historical memory not infrequent in Indian history. It may be mentioned that the Vikrama era is never used by Indian astro nomers for their calendaric calculations, for which puapose the śaka era is exclusively used. 

(e) Tho śaka Bra The śaka Era is the era par excellence which has been used by Indian astronomers all over India in their calculations since the time of the astronomer Varaha mihira (died 587 A.D.) and probably earlier. The Indian almanac-makers, even now, use the śaka era for calculations, and then convert the calculations to their own systems. 

This era is extensively used over the whole of India except in Tinnevelly and part of Malabar, and is more widely used than any otber era. It is also called śaka Kala, śaka Bhapa Kala, Sakendra Kala, and Salivabana śaka and also śaka Samvat. Its years are Caitrādi for luni-solar reckoning and Meṣādi for solar reckoning. In the luni-solar reckoning the months are pūrnimântā in the North and amāntā in Southern India. The reckoning of the śaka era begins with the vernal equi nox of 78 A.D., and is measured by expired years, so the year between the vernal equinox of 78 A.D. to that of 79 A.D. is zero of śaka era. In some pañcāṅgais of Southern India the current year is however seen to be used instead of the elapsed year, where the number of year of the era is one more than the era in general use 

But we are not yet sure about the origin of this era. It has been traced back to the śaka satraps of Ujjain, from the year 52 (130 A.D.) to the end of the dynasty about 395 A.D. But in their own records, they merely record it as year so and so, but there is not the slightest doubt that the era used by them subsequently became known as the śaka era (ride: 5.5) 

The Old and the New śaka era. The dates given by different authorities about the starting year of the old śaka era mentioned in § 5.5 vary from 155 B.C. to-88 B.G. as given below: Konow : 88 B.C. (date of death of Mithradates II, the 

powerful Parthian emperor who is 

said to have subjugated the Sakas). Konow has proposed a number of other dates. Jayaswal : 120 B.C. : Herzfeld : 110 B.C. : Settlement of the Sakas in 

..Seistan by Mithradates II. Rapson : 150 B.C. : Establishment of the śaka 

kingdom of Seistan. Tarn : 155 B.C. : Date of settlement of the śaka 

immigrants in Seistan by 

Mithradates I. Recently Dr. Van Lohuizen de Leeuw has discus sed the starting point of this era in her thought-provok ing book The Scythian Period of Indian History'. She bas Tejected all the above dates, and fixed up 129 B.C. as the starting date of the old śaka era. She identifies this year as the one in which the Śakas, descending from the Trans-Oxus region, attacked the Parthian empir 

"WOW

in which the Parthian emperor Phraates II was defea- ted and killed, and the rich. province of Bactria was occupied by the Sakas. They founded an era to com memorate their victory over the Parthians which their successors took to India, as they expanded and put an end to the Bactrian Greek principalities in Afghanistan and north-west Punjab. She suggests that the old Śaka era was also used by the Kuṣanas, who were after all a Sakish ruling tribe, but from the time of Kaniska with hundreds omitted. 

Dr. M. N. Saba has supported this theory in its main features, but he thinks that the era was founded in 123 B.C., for he shows from historical records that the Sakas assailed Bactria first in 129 B.C. and entered into a seven year conflict with the Parthians, and finally. conquered Bactria in 123 B.C., when the Par thian' emperor Artabanus II, was defeated and killed. Probably the Sakas then founded their era. This was also called the era of Azes. Dr. Van Lohuizen, de Leeuw has accepted Saha's suggestion. 

This hypothesis, though not finally settled appears to, have a good deal of probability, for the following reasons : . 

The points given in § 5.5 and above may be summarized as follows: 

(a) The Sakas starting from Central Asia attacked the Parthian empire in 129: B.C., and overcame Parthian resistance by 123 B.C. : It is very probable that they started an era to commemorate their accession to power in Bactria from 123 B.C. They used Macedonian months and Graeco-Chaldean methods of calendaric. calculations as prevalent in the Seleucid and Parthian dominions, Probably the era was some times named after Azes, who was probably their leader. But this Azes is not to be confounded with later Azes I or Azes II, who reigned in Taxila between 40 B.C. and 20 B.C. Within the first 200 years of its starting, the era was alternatively called the Azes era, 

(b) This śaka era ( known to archaeologists as the old Śaka era ) was used by the śaka emperors and śaka satraps in their Indian territories, but the time reckoning began to be gradually influenced by Indian customs. They began to use Indian months alter natively with Macedonian months and Parnimānta months in place of Amanta months. During the first 200 years, the hundreds were sometimes omitted, in the use of the era. : (c) The so-called Kaniska era is nothing but the old śaka era with 200 omitted. 

(d) The Śaka era was used by the house of Castana of Ujjain with 200 omitted, but gradually they forgot the origin of the era and continued their own reckoning without further omission of hundreds upto the end of the śaka satrapal rule over Ujjaini about 395 A.D. As the early Indian astronomers were mostly of foreign origin (viz. Sakadvipi Brahmana) the astronomical reckonings necessary for compiling the calendar were carried out using the śaka era and Graeco-Chaldean astronomy. The blending of Graeco-Chaldean astronomy as known about the early years of the Christian era with older Indian calendarical features formed the basis of Siddhānta Jyotiṣa. The Sakadvipi Brahmins also brought to India horoscopic astrology using the śaka era exclusively in horoscopes, a custom which has persisted to this day. These facts explain the pre-eminence of the śaka era. 

Dr. Saha points to the fact that Indian classics, which can be dated from the third century B.C. to the second century A.D., mentions three' races in what is modern Afghanistan and N. W. India, viz., the Sakas, the Yavanas, and the Pallavas, who attained to the status of ruling races. The order in which they are mentioned denotes correct chronological sequence, for they are arranged in the order of their chronological appearance in history, the Sakas being mentioned as a subject race in Darius's inscription (518 B.C.). But the Yavanas (Greeks) were the first to attain the status of a ruling race, from 312 B.C., the date of foundation of the Seleucid empire, whose power in the west was overthrown by the Parthians, or Pehlevis (Pallayas of Indian classics) in 248 B.C. 

(d) Other Eras 

Both these ruling races of Yavanas and Pallavas used eras of their own, viz., the Seleucidean era from 312 B.C., and the Parthian era from 248 B.C. Did the third race, viz., the Sakas who were the last to attain status of a ruling race ever use an era of their own ? It would be surprising if they did not, for it became the fashion for all races, who attained the status of ruting people, to have eras of their own. The early Sakas, -as their records stroge were deeply influenced by their neighbours to the west, viz., the Parthians who adopted Greek culture, and their coin-records show that they also adopted Greek culture, and therefore most probably, the Graeco-Chaldean method of date recording. 

Buddha Nirvana Era :-The Buddhists of Ceylon have been using since the first century B.C. the Buddhist Nirvana era, having its era-beginning in 544 

B.C. This era has not however been found in use on . the Indian soil, except for a solitary instance in

called Parganati- Abda, reckoned from the time of disappearance of Hindu rule. 

After the introduction of Tarikh Nahi, the people of Bengal began to use the Sarya Siddhānta reckoning, and the solar year. The Bengali San had thus a hybrid origin; to find the current year of the Bengali San, we take Hejira year elasped in 1556, i.e., 963 and add to it the number of solar years. Thus 1954 A. D. is 963 A.D.+(1954-1556)=1361 of Bengali San. 

era = 1270 A.D. Most of the antiquarians however put the date of Nirvāna in 483 B.C. The origin of the Buddha Nirvana era used in Ceylon has not yet been satisfactorly explained. . 

The Gupta Era :--This era was clearly \established by the founder of the Gupta dynasty (Candragupta I) to commemorate the accession to imperial power of his family, about 319 A.D., and was in vogue over the whole of Northern India from Saurashtra to Bengal during the days of their hegemony (319 A.D.-550 A.D.). · After the decay of their empire, the era was continued by their former vassals, the Maitrakas of Vallabhi and was in use in parts of Guzrat and Rajputana up to the thirteenth century. Its use in Bengal was discon tinued from about 510 A.D. with the disappearance of Gupta rule first in South Bengal, then over the whole of Eastern India. In the Uttar Pradesh (ancient Madhyadeśa), it was driven out by the Harșa era, which had a short period of existence, 606-824 A.D., when the city of Kanauj was occupied by king Nagabhata of the Pratibar dynasty, who hailed from Rajasthan. The Pratibārs brought with them the Vikrama era, which had been current in Rajasthan, and this became the great era of the north, used by all medieval Rajput dynasties, except those belonging to the eastern region.

Eras in Eastern India 

Most parts of Bengal were under the Gupta emperors, and used the Gupta era during their hegemony (319-510 A.D.). But Gupta rule disappeared as mentioned above from major parts of Bengal from ca. 510 A.D., and the subsequent dynasties including the Pala emperors ( 750 A.D.-1150 A.D.) used regnal years in their inscriptions for four hundred years of their rule. The śaka era in Bengal appear to have been introduced by the Sena dynasty which replaced the Palas; the Senas were migrants from the south (Karnata-Kṣatriyas ), where they were familiar with the śaka era, but it was not used in royal records which continued to use regnal years. The Vikrama Samvat never became popular in Bengal, or Eastern India. After Mohamedan conquest, Bengal was left without an era. For official purposes, Hejira was used, but the learned men used the śaka era, and the common people in certain parts used a rough reckoning, 

Other hybrid eras A number of other hybrid eras formed in a similar 

· way to Bengali San is mentioned in the table (No. 27): 

Amli and Vilayati in Bengal and Orissa, the various Fasli or harvest years in Bengal, Deccan, and Bombay. 

All the other eras mentioned as hybrid in the chart were formed in a similar way, and the slight differences are due to mistakes in calculation, or differences in the time of introduction. While the Bengali San has Meṣadi . as year-beginning, others have taken the year-beginning to be coincident with some important mythical event of local provenance, e.g., the year-beginning of the Amli era used in Orissa, viz., the 12th lunar day of the light half of the month of Bhadra is said to represent the birth date of king Indradyumna, the mythical king who is said to have discovered the site of modern Puri. The great temple of Puri was actually built by king Anyanka Bhim Dev of the Gangã dynasty about 1119 A.D., and kings of this dynasty who held sway in Orissa from 1035-1400, A. D. used the Ganga era, 

The Kollam era prevalent in the Malayalam countries is of obscure origin. The year of this era is known as the Kollam Andu. The era is also called the Era of Paraśurāma, and is said to have omitted thousands from their previous reckonings. In South Malabar it begins with the solar month Simha and in North Malabar with the solar month Kanya. The era started from 825 A.D. 

The Jovian cycle : In Southern India the years are named after the name of the Jovian year and so it also serves the purpose of an era of a short period, viz., 60 years, after which the years recur. Details about Jovian years will be found in Appendix 5-E.
