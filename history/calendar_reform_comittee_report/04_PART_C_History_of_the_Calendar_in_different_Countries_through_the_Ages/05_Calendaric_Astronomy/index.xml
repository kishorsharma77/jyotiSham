      <description>The scheme of lunar months given in Table No. 4 in a nineteen-year period, which came into vogue in Babylon about 383 B.C. did not, however, completely satisfy the needs of the Babylonian calendar, because for religious purposes, the month was to start on the day the crescent moon was first visible in the western horizon after conjunction with the sun (the new moon), a custom which is still followed in the Islamic countries.</description>

      <description>The moon gains on the sun at the average rate of 12.2° per day, but it did not take the ancients long to discover that the daily gain of the moon on the sun is far from uniform ; in fact as we know now, it varies from approximately 10.75° to 14.5° per day. It was therefore not possible to say beforehand whether the crescent moon would appear on the 29th or on the 30th day after the beginning of the previous month.</description>

      <description>Observations of the positions of the sun, the moon, planets and stars are now made very accurately with elaborate instruments installed in observatories. But these instruments have been evolved after thousands of years of experience and application of human ingenuity, and have undergone radical changes in design and set-up with every great technological discovery. But let us see how the early astronomers who had no instruments or very primitive ones made observations, collected the fundamental data, and evolved the basic astronomical ideas.</description>

      <description>Almost all ancient nations were familiar with the night-sky either as shepherds, travellers or navigators, and were acquainted with more detailed knowledge of the revolving blue firmament studded with stars than the modern city dweller. The striking constelltions like the Great Bear, the Pleiades, the Orion could not but catch their fancy and references to these star groups are found in ancient literature, in the Vedas, in the book of Job (the Bible) and in Homer.</description>

      <description>THE APPARENT PATH OF THE SUN IN THE SKY
The apparent path of the sun in the sky is known in astronomical language as the ecliptic. It is a great circle cutting the celestial equator at an angle of ca 23.5° (exactly 23° 26&#39; 43&amp;quot; in 1955, but the angle varies from 22° 35&#39; to 24° 13&#39;). This is known as the obliquity of the ecliptic.
The ecliptic is the most important reference circle in the heavens, and let us see how a knowledge of it was obtained in ancient times.</description>

      <description>The early astronomers must have found that the sun&amp;rsquo;s path in the heavens was almost fixed, while that of the moon, and of the planets, which acquired for astrological reasons great importance from about 1200 B.C., strayed some degrees to the north and south of the ecliptic.
In case of the moon the deviation from the ecliptic was found to be not much greater than 5°, but some of the planets strayed much more ; in the case of Venus, her perpendicular distance from the ecliptic rises sometimes as high as 80 degrees.</description>

      <description>Sun and moon observation We have seen that it was the needs of the calendar which gave rise to scientific astronomy which in the earliest times covered :
 (a) Systematic observation of the movements of the moon, and the sun, (b) Recording of the observations in some convenient form on permanent materials, (c) Invention of mathematical methods to deal with the observations, with a view to predict astronomical events.  It is not, however, correct to say that it was the calendar based on the sun and the moon which provided the sole stimulus for astronomical studies.</description>

      <title>08 GREEK CONTRIBUTION TO ASTRONOMY</title>

      <description>Intro It has been considered neccessary to give a short account of Greek contributions to astronomy, because there is a widespread view that it was Greek astronomy which formed the basis of calendar reform in India which took place about 400 A.D. ( Siddhānta Jyotiṣa calendar). Let us see how far this view is correct. The Greeks themselves appear to have made no use of astronomy for the reform of their own calendars, as was done later in India.</description>

      <description>Intro In the previous sections, we have stated how the Chaldean and Greek astronomers started giving positions of planets, and stars, with the point of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator—the first point of Aries-as the fiducial point. We shall now relate how the discovery was made that this point is not fixed in the heavens, but has a slow motion along the ecliptic to the west at the rate of ca.</description>

      <description>APPENDIX 4-A Newton&amp;rsquo;s Explanation of the Precession
In view of the prevailing confusion in the minds of Indian almanac makers regarding precession of the equinoxes, &amp;amp; short sketch of the physical explanation of the phenomenon originally given first by Newton is given here in the hope that those amongst Indian calendar makers who believe in science, may be persuaded to give up their belief in the theory of trepidation and be converted to the sayana reckoning advocated in these pages.</description>
