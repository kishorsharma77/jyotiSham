      <description>Lunar calendar Like other nations of antiquity the early Egyptians had a year of 360 days divided into 12 months, each of 30 days; but they found very early from the recurrence of the Nile flood, that the seasonal year consisted approximately of 365 days, and that a month or lunation (period from one new-moon to another) was nearly 29.4 days (real length 29.531 days). But they had already framed a calendar on the 30-day month, and 360-day year, which had received religious sanction.</description>

      <description>The story of the calendar in Egypt has been given in full, because the ancient Egyptians evolved a very simple and convenient calendar which, as mentioned before, would have been almost perfect (provided the year was taken to consist of 365 1/4 days instead of 365 days). This was rendered possible by their bold initiative of discarding the moon as a time-marker. But people in the remaining parts of the civilized world (e.</description>

      <description>The great Iranian conqueror Darius (520 B. C.), whose empire comprised Egypt, Mesopotamia, Syria and Asia Minor, besides his native country of Iran, certainly came into contact with the diverse calendars of older civilizations, but he appears to have preferred the Egyptian calendar to the more complex Babylonian calendar, and introduced it in his vast empire.
But the astronomers of Darius made correction of the deficit of 1 day of the year in another way.</description>

      <description>The Egyptian calendar attracted the notice of the calendar committee of the French Revolutionary Government (1789-1795) who wanted to replace Religion by Reason. The committee consisted, amongst others, the great mathematicians Laplace and Lagrange and the poet d&amp;rsquo;Eglantine. Laplace proposed that the year 1250 A.D., when according to his calculations the equinoctial line was perpendicular to the apse line +++(=major axis)+++ of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s orbit should be taken the starting point of the French Revolution Era in place of a hypothetical year of Christ&amp;rsquo;s birth.</description>

      <description>(The Christian Calendar) What is now known as the Christian calendar, and used all over the world for civil purposes, had originally nothing to do with Christianity. It was, according to one view, originally the calendar of semi-savage tribes of Northern Europe, who started their year sometime before the beginning of Spring (March 1 to 25) and had only ten months of 304 days ending about the time of winter solstice (December 25), the remaining 61 days forming a period of hybernation when no work could be done due to the onset of winter, and were not counted at all.</description>

      <description>The Julian year of 365.25 days was longer than the true year of 365.2422 by .0078 days, so the winter solstice day which fell on December 21 in 323 A.D., fell back by 10 days in 1582 A.D. and the Christmas day appeared to be losing all connections with the winter solstice. Similar discrepancy was also noticed in connection with the observance of the Easter.*
* Easter, the most joyous of the Christian festivals, is observed annually throughout Christendom in commemoration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, on the first Sunday after the full-moon following the vernal equinox day.</description>

      <description>Drawbacks of Gregorian calendar As already stated the Gregorian calendar is a most inconvenient system of time-reckoning. The days of the months vary from 28 to 31 ; quarters consist of 90 to 92 days; and the two half years contain 181 and 184 days. The week-days wander about the month from year to year, so the year and month beginnings may fall on any week-day, and this causes serious inconvenience to civic and economic activities.</description>
