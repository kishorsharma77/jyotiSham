      <description>Time indicators The Flux of Time, of which we are all conscious, is apparently without beginning or end, but it is cut up periodically by several natural phenomena, viz. :
 (1) by the ever-recurring alternation of daylight and night, (2) by the recurrence of the moon&amp;rsquo;s phases, (3) by the recurrence of seasons.  It is these recurring phenomena which are used to measure time.
These phenomena have the greatest importance for man, for they determine all human and animal life.</description>

      <description>The three events mentioned in (1), (2) and (3) above define the natural divisions of time. They are :
The Day: defined by the alternation of daylight and night.
The Month : the complete cycle of moon&amp;rsquo;s changes of phase, from end of mew-moon to next end of new moon (amānta months), or end of full-moon to end of next full-moon (Pūrṇimānta months).
The Year : and its smaller subdivisions, viz.</description>

      <description>Whatever may be the correct lengths of the astronomical month and the year, for application to human life, the following points have to be observed in framing a civil calendar.
 (a) The civil year and the month must have an integral number of days. (b) The starting day of the year, and of the month should be suitably defined. The dates must correspond strictly to seasons. (c) For purposes of continuous dating, an era should be used, and it should be properly defined.</description>

      <description>For pactical purposes, the day is divided into 24 hours, an hour into sixty, minutes and a minute into sixty seconds.
Time keeping devices 1 mean solar day=24 x 60 x 60 = 86,400 seconds. The subdivisions of time are measured by highly developed mechanical contrivances (clocks, watches and chronometers), but they have come into use only during comparatively recent times. The ancient people used very primitive devices.
The time-keeping apparatus of the ancients were the gnomon, the sundial, and the water-clock or the clepsydra.</description>

      <description>Solar calendars In the following sections, the different ways of tackling the calendar problem in different centres of civilization have been described. We have described in Chap. II, the purely solar calendars, in which the moon is altogether discarded as a time-marker. This practice originated in Egypt about 3000 B.C. These calendars require only a correct knowledge of the length of year, and are therefore comparatively simpler. They required very little or almost no knowledge of astronomy.</description>

      <description>Ambiguity in calendar dates Though the Flux of Time is a continuous process, it is divided for the sake of convenience and for natural reasons too, into years, months and days. The years are mostly counted from the beginning of an era, so that if we wish to date a memorable event, say the birth day of George Washington, it can be seen from an inspection of his birth register that it took place on Feb.</description>
