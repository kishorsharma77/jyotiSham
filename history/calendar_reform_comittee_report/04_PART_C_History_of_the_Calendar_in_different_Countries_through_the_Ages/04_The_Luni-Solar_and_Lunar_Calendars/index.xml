      <description>The Egyptians appear to have been the only cultural nation of antiquity who discarded the moon entirely as a time-marker. Other contemporaneous cultural nations, e.g. the Sumero-Akkadians of Babylon, and the Vedic Indians retained both the sun and the moon as time-markers, the sun for the year, the moon for the month.
The Indian astronomers called the moon māsakrt, (month-maker) and before the Siddhānta Jyotiṣa time, the moon was considered more important as a time marker than the sun (vide §5).</description>

      <description>EMPIRICAL RELATION BETWEEN THE YEAR AND THE MONTH
The solar year has thus a pretty nearly constant value, but even the earliest astronomers appear to have observed, that the lunation, or the synodic period of the moon is not a constant, but is variable. As a matter of fact, the period varies from 29.246 to 29.817 days-nearly fourteen hours. The observation of the actual motion of the moon formed the most formidable problem in ancient astronomy (vide §4).</description>

      <description>In addition to the Chaldeans, many other nations of antiquity, viz..the Vedic Indians, the Greeks, the Romans and the Jews and others used the luni-solar calendar, and had to make luni-solar adjustments. It will be tedious to relate how they did it, except in the case of the Vedic Indians (vide § 5). But the knowledge of the nineteen-year rule appears to have diffused to all countries by the first century of the Christian era.</description>

      <description>Early eras For accurate date-recording, we require besides the month and the day, also a continuously running era. But the era came rather late in human history. We find dated records of kings in Babylon from about 1700 B.C. (Kassite kings). They used regnal years, lunar months, and the day of the lunar month. The ancient Egyptian records do not use any era, but sometimes the regnal years. But the use of regnal years is very inconvenient for purposes of exact chronology, because one has to locate the beginning of the reign of the king on the time-scale which often proves to be an extremely difficult problem, e.</description>

      <description>Since the introduction of the Seleucidean era, the practice arose for a nation or a dynasty to start eras commemorating some great event in their national or dynastic life. The first in record is the Parthian era, and the story of its starting is well-known. The Seleucid emperors ruled the Near East from 312 B.C. imposing on the countries under their domination Greek culture, the Seleucidean era, and the Graeco Chaldean system of time-reckoning.</description>

      <description>The ancient Jewish calendar was lunar, the beginning of the month being determined by the first visibility of the lunar crescent. As the month-names show (col. 4 of the table No. 4.), they were evidently derived from the Babylonian month-names excepting one or two, viz., Marheshvan and Tammuz. The day began in the evening and probably at sunset. The year used to begin with the spring month Abib or Nisan, the latter being the Babylonian name of the month which was adopted by the Jews in the post-exilic times.</description>

      <description>The Mohammedan calendar is purely lunar and has no connection with the solar year. The year consists of 12 lunar months, the beginning of each month being determined by the first observation of the crescent moon in the evening sky. The months have accordingly got 29 or 30 days and the year 354 or 355 days. The new-year day of the Mohammedan calendar thus retrogrades through the seasons and completes the cycle in a period of about 324 solar years.</description>
