There was once, then, a Golden Age. Why, how, did it come 
to an end? This has been a deep concern of mankind over time, 
refracted in a hundred myths, explained in so many ways which 
always expressed sorrow, nostalgia, despondency. Why did man 
lose the Garden of Eden? The answer has always been, because of 
some original sin. But the idea that man alone was able to commit 
sin, that Adam and Eve are the guilty ones, is not very old. The 
authors of the Old Testament had developed a certain conceit. 
Christianity then had to come to rescue and restore cosmic propor¬ 
tions, by insisting that God alone could offer himself in atonement. 

In archaic times, this had seemed to be self-evident. The gods 
alone could run or wreck the universe. It is there that we should 
search for the origin of evil. For evil remains a mystery. It is not 
in nature. The faultless and all-powerful machine of the heavens 
should have yielded only harmony and perfection, the reign of 
justice and innocence, rivers flowing with milk and honey. It did, 
but that time did not last. Why did history begin to happen? His¬ 
tory is always terrible. Philosophers from Plato to Hegel have 
offered their own lofty answer: pure Being was confronted of a 
necessity with Non-Being, and the result was Becoming, which is 
an uninsurable business. This was substantially the original answer 
of archaic times, but because of the lack of abstractions, it had to be 
derived in terms of heavenly motions. 

Aristotle, the Master of Those Who Know, has cleared up this 
matter in a most important, yet little noted passage of Book Lambda

of Metaphysics (1074b) where he talks about Kronos, Zeus, Aphro¬ 
dite, etc.: 

Our forefathers in the most remote ages [archaioi kai panpalaioi ] 
have handed down to their posterity a tradition, in the form 
f schema] of a myth, that these bodies are gods and that the divine 
encloses the whole of nature. The rest of the tradition has been added 
later in mythical form . . . ; they say that these gods are in the form 
of men or like some of the other animals . . . But if one were to 
separate the first point from these additions and take it alone—that 
they thought the first substances to be gods, one must regard this as 
an inspired utterance, and reflect that, while probably each art and 
each science has often been developed as far as possible and has again 
perished, these opinions, with others, have been preserved until the 
present like relics [leipsana] of the ancient treasure. 

Aristotle, being a true Greek, cannot conceive of progress in our 
sense. Time proceeds for him in cycles of flowering and decay. 
But this absence of modern preconceptions had left his mind open 
to an ancient certainty. This certainty is what shines through the 
mist of ages and through a language dimly understood. It was atten¬ 
tion to the events of heaven which shaped men’s minds before re¬ 
corded history; but since there was as yet no writing, these thoughts 
have receded, as astrophysicists would say, over the “event hori¬ 
zon.” They can survive only through fragments of tale and myth 
because these made up the only technical language of those times. 

Yet an enormous intellectual achievement is presupposed in this 
organization of heaven, in naming the constellations and in tracing 
the paths of the planets. Lofty and intricate theories grew to ac¬ 
count for the motions of the cosmos. One would wonder about this 
obsessive concern with the stars and their motion, were it not the 
case that those early thinkers thought they had located the gods 
which rule the universe and with it also the destiny of the soul 
down here and after death. 

In modern language, they had found the essential invariants 
where Being is. In paying respect to those forefathers, Aristotle 
shows himself clearly aware that his philosophical quest started with 
them. 

One should pay attention to the cosmological information con¬ 
tained in ancient myth, information of chaos, struggle and violence.

They are not mere projections of a troubled consciousness: They 
are attempts to portray the forces which seem to have taken part 
in the shaping of the cosmos. Monsters, Titans, giants locked in 
battle with the gods and trying to scale Olympus are functions and 
components of the order that is finally established. 

A distinction is immediately clear. The fixed stars are the essence 
of Being, their assembly stands for the hidden counsels and the 
unspoken laws that rule the Whole. The planets, seen as gods, 
represent the Forces and the Will: all the forces there are, each of 
them seen as one aspect of heavenly power, each of them one 
aspect of the ruthless necessity and precision expressed by heaven. 
One might also say that while the fixed stars represent the kingly 
power, silent and unmoving, the planets are the executive power. 

Are they in total harmony? This is the dream that the contem¬ 
plative mind has expressed again and again, that Kepler tried to fix 
by writing down the notes of his “Harmony of the Spheres,” and 
that was consecrated in the “turning over” of the sky. This is the 
faith expressed by ancient thinkers in a Great Year, in which all the 
motions brought back all the planets to the same original configura¬ 
tion. But the computations created doubt very early and with it 
anxiety. Only rarely is there an explicit technical statement of those 
views. Here is one from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Osiris 
speaking: 

“Hail, Thot! What is it that hath happened to the divine children of 
Nut? They have done battle, they have upheld strife, they have made 
slaughter, they have caused trouble: in truth, in all their doing the 
mighty have worked against the weak. Grant, O might of Thot, that 
that which the God Atum hath decreed (may be accomplished)! And 
thou regardest not evil nor art thou provoked to anger when they 
bring their years to confusion and throng in atid push to disturb their 
months; for in all that they have done unto thee, they have worked 
iniquity in secret. rn 

Thot is the god of science and wisdom; as for Atum, he precedes, 
so to speak, the divine hierarchy. Described only in metaphysical 
terms, he is the mysterious entity from which the All sprang: his

name might be Bcginning-and-End. He is thus the Presence and the 
secret Counsel whom one feels tempted to equate with the starry 
sky itself. His decree must be of immutable perfection. But here it 
appears that there are forces which have worked iniquity in secret. 
They appear everywhere, these forces, and regularly they are de¬ 
nounced as “overbearing,” or “iniquitous,” or both. But these 
“forces” are not iniquitous right from the beginning: they turn out 
to be, they become overbearing in the course of time. Time alone 
turns the Titans, who once ruled the Golden Age, into “workers of 
iniquity” (compare appendix #12). The idea of measure stated or 
implied will show the basic crime of these “sinners”: it is the over¬ 
reaching, overstepping of the ordained degree, and this is meant 
literally. 2 Says the Mahabharata about the Indian Titans, the Asura: 
“assuredly were the Asura originally just, good and charitable, knew 
the Dharma and sacrificed, and were possessed of many other vir¬ 
tues . . . But afterwards as they multiplied in number, they became 
proud, vain, quarrelsome . . . they made confusion in everything. 
Thereupon in the course of time . . they were doomed. 3 

Thus severe consequences must be expected when Gen. vi. 1 com¬ 
mences with the formula, “when men began to multiply on the 
face of the earth . .And sure enough, ten verses later, Gen. vi.i 1, 
the time for grave decisions has come: “And God said to Noah, 
‘I have determined to make an end of all flesh!’ ” More outspoken 
is the 18th chapter of the Book of Enoch, where an Angel acts as 
Enoch’s guide through the celestial landscape. In showing him the 
quarters destined for iniquitous personalities, the Angel tells Enoch: 
“These stars which roll around over the fire are those who, at rising 
time, overstepped the orders of God: they did not rise at their ap- 

2 It is only the careless manner in which we usually deal with precise terms that 
blocks the understanding: e.g., Greek ?noira, also written moros , is translated as 
“fate,” “destiny,” sometimes as “doom”; moira is one degree of the 360° of the 
circle; when we keep this in mind we understand better such lines as Od. /. 
34-35, where Aegisthus is accused twice of having done deeds “ hyper moron ” 
beyond degree. How could one overstep one’s destiny? How could one be over¬ 
measured against fate? This would invalidate the very concept of “destiny.”

pointed time. And He was wroth with them, and He bound them 
for 10,000 years until the time when their sin shall be fulfilled.” 4 

Yet one must beware of simplifications. The wording, “assuredly 
were the Asura originally just, good and charitable,” goes for the 
Titans, too, the forces of the first age of the world. But seen 
through the “eyeglasses” of the preceding state of things, Titans, 
Asura and their like had committed atrocities first. And so did 
Saturn, the “originator of times,” and in the drastic measure he 
took to accomplish the “separation of the parents of the world,” 
which stands for the falling apart of the axes of equator and 
ecliptic. Before this separation time did not exist. These “united 
parents”—heartlessly called “chaos” by Macrobius—resented the 
breaking up of the original eternity by the forces which worked 
iniquity in secret. 5 These forces as they appear in the Enuma elish, 
the so-called Babylonian Creation Epic, are the children of Apsu 
and Tiamat and they crowded in between their parents. “They 
disturbed Tiamat as they surged back and forth; yea, they troubled 
the mood of Tiamat. Apsu could not lessen their clamor . . . Un¬ 
savory were their ways, they were overbearing.” 6 

Not having “multiplied” yet, this first generation of the world 
established the Golden Age under the rule of Him of many names 
—Enki, Yima, Freyr and many more. “But these sons whom he 
begot himself, great Heaven [megas Ouranos ] used to call Titans 
[Strainers] in reproach, for he said that they strained and did pre¬ 
sumptuously a fearful deed, and that vengeance for it would come 
afterwards,” as Hesiod has it ( Theogony 207-10). 7 And so it 
would, after their “multiplication,” when they overstrained the

(1900), vol. 2, pp. 249E 

5 There is no complete unanimity among mythographers, though; in Hesiod’s 
Theogony, Gaia “rejoiced greatly in spirit” (173) when Kronos promised to do 
away with Father Ouranos according to Gaia’s very own plan and advice.

7 This translation by H. G. Evelyn-White (LCL) pays no regard to a “pun,” a 
rather essential one, indeed. Hesiod makes use, side by side in these few lines, of 
both radicals from which “Titan” was supposed to have been derived: titaind, “to 
strain,” and tisis, “vengeance.”

measure. And it was bound to happen again when future genera¬ 
tions would construct “forbidden ways to the sky,” 8 or build a 
tower which happened to be too high. The one secure measure, the 
“golden rope” of the solar year, 9 is stretched beyond repair. The 
equinoctial sun had been gradually pushed out of its Golden Age 
“sign.” it had started on the way to new conditions, new configura¬ 
tions. This is the frightful event, the unexpiable crime that was 
ascribed to the Children of Heaven. They had nudged the sun out 
of place, and now it was on the move, the universe was out of kilter 
and nothing, nothing—days, months or years, the rising or setting of 
stars—was going to fall into its rightful place any more. The equi¬ 
noctial point had nudged and nuzzled its way forward, in the very 
same way as a car with automatic gearshift will nuzzle its way for¬ 
ward unless we put it in neutral—and there was no way of putting 
the equinox in neutral. The infernal pushing and squeezing of the 
Children of Heaven had separated the parents, and now the time 
machine had been set rolling forever, bringing forth at every new 
age “a new heaven and a new earth,” in the words of Scripture. As 
Hesiod says, the world had entered now the second stage, that of 
the giants, who were to wage a decisive battle with the restraining 
forces before their downfall. 

The vision of a whole world-age with its downfall is given by 
the Edda. It comes in the very first poem, the Song of the Sibyl, the 
Voluspa, in which the prophetess Vala embraces past and future in 
adequately strange and obscure language. At the beginning of the 
Age of the Aesir, the gods gather in council, and give names to 
sun and moon, days and nights and seasons. They order the years 
and assign to the stars their places. On Idavollr (the “whirl-field”; 
ida = eddy), they establish their seat “in the Golden Age” and play 
checkers with golden pieces, and all is happiness until “the three 
awful maidens” come (this is another mystery). 10 But once before, 

8 Claudiamis 26.69-71, speaking of the Aloads, who piled Ossa upon Olympus. 

9 See e.g., RV 5.85.5: “This great feat of the famous Asurian Varuna I shall pro¬ 
claim who, standing in the air, using the Sun as an inch scale, measured the earth.” 

10 The three maidens from Jotunheimr are not the Norns, this much can be safely 
said, but should be Gulveig the “thrice born,” whom the Aesir killed “thrice, and 
still she is living” (Voluspa 8): one more “iniquity” asking for vengeance. 







155 ' The Twilight of the Gods 

it is hinted, there has been a “world war” between Aesir and Vanir, 
which was terminated by a sharing of power. In a vision in which 
past and future blend in a flash, Vala sees the outcome and an¬ 
nounces it to the “high and low children of Heimdal,” that is, to 
all men. She asks them to open their eyes, to understand what the 
gods had to know: the breaking of the peace, the murder of Thjassi, 
Odin himself abetting the crime and nailing Thjassi’s eyes to 
heaven. With this a curtain is lifted briefly over a phase of the 
past. For Thjassi belongs to the powers that preceded the Aesir. 
In Greek terms, the Titans came before the gods. The main Vana 
or Titanic powers (in Rydberg’s thoughtful reconstruction) are 
the three brothers, Thjassi/Volund, Orvandil/Eigil, and Slagfin: 
the Maker, the Archer, and the Musician. This finally locates Or- 
vandil the Archer, the father of Amlethus. He is one of the three 
“sons of Ivalde,” just as their counterparts in the Finnish epic are 
the “sons of Kaleva.” 11 And Ivalde, like Kaleva, is barely mentioned, 
never described, at least not under the name Ivalde: there is a 
glimpse at him under his other name, Wate. Like Kaleva, he is a 
meaningful void. But all this is of the past. The Sibyl’s vision is 
projected toward the onrushing end. True, Loke has been chained 
in Hell since he brought about the death of Balder, the great Fenrir 
wolf is still fettered with chains, once cunningly devised by Loke 
himself, and they are made up of such unsubstantial things as the 
footfall of a cat, the roots of a rock, the breath of a fish, the spittle 
of a bird. 12 

Now the powers of the Abyss are beginning to rise, the world is 
coming apart. At this point Heimdal comes to the fore. He is the 
Warner of Asgard, the guardian of the Bridge between heaven and 
earth, the “Whitest of the Aesir,” but his role, his freedom of 
action, is severely limited. He has many gifts—he can hear grass 
grow, he can see a hundred miles away—but these powers seem to 

11 Strange to say, the three brothers, Volund, Eigil and Slagfin, are called “synir 
Finnakonungs,” i.e., “sons of a Finnish king” (J. Grimm, TM, p. 380). 

12 Again, strange to say, this very kind of “un-substance”— including the milk of 
Mother Eagle, and the tears of the fledglings—had to be provided for by Tibetan 
Bogda Gesser Khan, who also snared the sun.

remain ineffectual. He owns the Gjallarhorn, the great battle horn 
of the gods; he is the only one able to sound it, but he will blow it 
only once, when he summons the gods and heroes of Asgard to 
their last fight. 

Nordic speculation down to Richard Wagner has dwelt with 
gloomy satisfaction on Ragnarok, 13 the Twilight of the Gods, which 
will destroy the world. There is the prediction in the Song of 
the Sibyl, and also in Snorri’s Gylfagmning: when the great dog 
Garm barks in front of the Gnipa cave, when the Fenrir wolf 
breaks his fetters and comes from “the mouth of the river,” 14 his 
jaws stretching from heaven to earth, and is joined by the Midgard 
Serpent, then Heimdal will blow the Gjallarhorn, the sound of 
which reaches through all the worlds: the battle is on. But it is 
written that the forces of order will go down fighting to atone for 
the initial wrong done by the gods. The world will be lost, good 
and bad together. Naglfar, the ship of the dead, built with the 
nail parings of the living, will sail through the dark waters and 
bring the enemy to the fray. Then, adds Snorri: 

The heavens are suddenly rent in twain, and out ride in shining squad¬ 
rons iMuspel’s sons, and Surt with his flaming sword, at the head of 
the fylkings. 15 

13 For the etymology of ragnarok, see Cleasby-Vigfusson, An Icelandic-English 
Dictionary, in which regin (whence ragna) is defined as “the gods as the makers 
and rulers of the universe”; rok as “reason, ground, origin” or “a wonder, sign, 
marvel”; and ragna rok as “the history of the gods and the world, but especially 
with reference to the last act, the last judgment.” The word rokr, a possible alter¬ 
nate to rok, is defined as “the twilight . . . seldom of the morning twilight,” and 
“the mythological phrase, ragna rokr, the twilight of gods, which occurs in the 
prose Edda (by Snorri), and has since been received into modern works, is no 
doubt merely a corruption from rok, a word quite different from rokr .” 

Taking into consideration that the whole war between the Pandavas and the 
Kauravas, as told in the Mahabharata, takes place in the “twilight” between 
Dvapara and Kali Yuga, there is no cogent reason to dismiss Snorri’s ragna rokr 
as a “corruption.” But then, the experts also condemned Snorri’s comparison be¬ 
tween Ragnarok and the Fall of Troy: the logical outcome of their conviction that 
“poetry” is some kind of creatio ex nihilo, whence the one question never raised 
is whether the poets might not be dealing with hard scientific facts.

157 * The Twilight of the Gods 

All-engulfing flames come out with Surt “the Black,” who kills 
Freyr, the Lord of the Mill. Snorri makes Surt “Lord of Gimle” 
and likewise the king of eternal bliss “at the southern end of the 
sky.” 16 He must be some timeless force which brings destructive 
fire to the world; but of this later. 

Hitherto all has been luridly and catastrophically and murkily 
confused as it should be. But the character of Heimdal raises a 
number of sharp questions. He has appeared upon the scene as “the 
son of nine mothers”; to be the son of several mothers is a rare dis¬ 
tinction even in mythology, and one which Heimdal shares only 
with Agni in the Rigveda, 17 and with Agni’s son Skanda in the 
Mahabharata. Skanda (literally “the jumping one” or “the hopping 
one”) is the planet Mars, also called Kartikeya, inasmuch as he was 
borne by the Krittika, the Pleiades. The Mahabharata 18 insists on 
six as the number of the Pleiades as well as of the mothers of Skanda 
and gives a very broad and wild description of the birth and the 
installation of Kartikeya “by the assembled gods ... as their gen¬ 
eralissimo,” which is shattering, somehow, driving home how little 
one understands as yet. 19 

The nine mothers of Heimdal bring to mind inevitably the nine 
goddesses who turn the mill. The suspicion is not unfounded. Two 
of these “mothers,” Gjalp and Greip, seem to appear with changed 

16 Gylf. 17;, cf. R. B. Anderson, The Younger Edda (1880), p. 249. That Surt is 
Lord of Gimle is a particularly important statement; it will not be found in the 
current translations of Snorri, but only in the Uppsala Codex: “there are many 
good abodes and many bad; best it is to be in Gimle with Surt” (Rydberg, p. 651). 

17 RV /0.45.2 points to nine births, or mothers; 7.141.2 tells of the seven mothers 
of Agni’s second birth. Most frequently, however, Agni has three “mothers,” cor¬ 
responding to his three birthplaces: in the sky, on the earth, in the waters. 

18 Mbh. £.44-46 (Roy trans. vol. 7, pp. 130-43). It should be emphasized, aloud 
and strongly, that in Babylonian astronomy Mars is the only planetary representa¬ 
tive of the Pleiades. See P. F. Gossmann, Flanetariwn Babylonicum (1950), p. 279: 
“In der Planetenvertretung kommt fur die Plejaden nur Mars in Fragc.” 

19 The least which can be said, assuredly: Mars was “installed” during a more or 
less close conjunction of all planets; in Mbh. £45 (p. 133) it is stressed that the 
powerful gods assembled “all poured water upon Skanda, even as the gods had 
poured water on the head of Varuna, the lord of waters, for investing him with 
dominion.” And this “investiture” took place at the beginning of the Krita Yuga, 
the Golden Age.

names or generations as Fenja and Menja. 20 Rydberg claims Heim- 
dal to be the son of Mundilfocri. The story is then astronomical. 
Where docs it lead? Thanks to the clues provided by Jacob Grimm, 
Rydberg and O. S. Reuter, and thanks to many hints hidden in the 
Rigveda, Atharva Veda and at other unexpected places, one can 
offer a probable conclusion: Heimdal stands for the world axis, 
the skambha. His head is the “measurer” (mjotudr) of the same 
measures that the Sibyl claims to understand: “Nine worlds I know, 
nine spaces of the measure-tree which is beyond (fyr ) the earth.” 
“Measure-tree” is the translation of mjotvidr,- 1 which so-called 
poetic versions usually render as “world tree.” The word fyr ap¬ 
pears here again; it connotes priority; in this verse 2 of Voluspa it 
is translated as “below” in most of the cases. The question “who 
measures what?” would require an extensive analysis; here, with 
no need for so many details, it is important only to learn that Heim¬ 
dal is honored by a second name, Hallmskidi (appendix #16). 
This name is said to mean a bent, bowed or slanted stake or post. 
To be bent or inclined befits the world axis and all that belongs 
to it, with the one exception of the observer who stands exactly at 
the terrestrial North Pole. Why not call it “oblique” or slanting 
right away? 22 Whether bent or oblique, Grimm rightly says that it 

20 For the names of these mothers, see Hyndluljod 38; for Gjalp and Greip, 
daughters of the giant Geirroed, see Snorri’s Skaldskaparmal 2, and Thorsdrapa , 
broadly discussed by Rydberg (pp. 932-52), who established Greip as the mother 
of the “Sons of Ivalde.” R. Much claims the identity of Geirroed with Surt (“Der 
germanische Himmelsgott,” in Ablandlungen zur germanische Pbilologie [1898], 
p. 221). The turning up of a plurality of mothers in the ancient North, and in India 
(see also J. Pokorny, “Ein neun-monatiges Jahr im Keltischen,” OLZ 21 [1918], 
pp. 130-33) might induce the experts eventually to reopen the trial of those per¬ 
fectly nonsensical seven or nine, even fourteen, “motherwombs” which haunt the 
Babylonian account of the creation of man. (Cf. E. Ebeling, Tod und Leben 
[1931], pp. 172-77; E. A. Speiser (trans.), “Akkadian Myths and Epics,” ANET, 
pp. 99E; W. von Soden, Or. 26, pp. 309ft.) 

21 O. S. Reuter, Germanische Hivrmelskunde (1934), pp. 236, 319. As concerns 
mjotudr (measurer) and its connection with Sanskrit matar and with meter, men- 
sar , etc., see Grimm, TM, pp. 22, 1290. Reuter (p. 236) quotes Lex. Poet. Boreale 
408, where mjotudr = fate. 

22 We have more of this mythological species of oblique posts or trees—e.g., the 
Rigvedic “sacrificial post”—and even Bears are not afraid to inhabit the one or the 
other. See F. G. Speck and J. Moses, The Celestial Bear Comes Down to Earth: 
The Bear Sacrifice Ceremony of the Manse e-Mohican in Canada (1945). 









159 ’ The Twilight of the Gods 

is “worthy of remark that Hallinskidi and Heimdal are quoted 
among the names for the ram. 23 Heimdal is the “watcher" of the 
much-trodden Bridge of the gods which finally breaks down at 
Ragnarok; his “head” measures the crossroads of ecliptic and 
equator at the vernal equinox in Aries, 24 a constellation which is 
called “head” also by Cleomedes, 25 and countless astromedical illus¬ 
trations show the Ram ruling the head (Pisces the feet). Accord¬ 
ingly, one might say that the Sibyl addresses herself to “the high 
and low children of Aries.” 

Recalling Rigvedic Agni, son of seven to nine mothers like Heim¬ 
dal, and remembering what has been said of “fire,” that it means 
a great circle connecting the celestial poles, the scheme becomes 
more understandable. Heimdal stands for the equinoctial colure 
which “accompanies” the slowly turning, wholly abstract and invis¬ 
ible axis along the surface of the sphere. It will emerge presently 
that “axis” always means the whole “frame” of a world-age, given 
by the equinoctial and solstitial colures. 26 More understandable also 
becomes another epithet of Heimdal, namely, Vindler , of which 
Rydberg states (p. 595): “The name is a subform of vindill and 
comes from vinda, to twist or turn, wind, to turn anything around 
rapidly. As the epithet ‘the turner 1 is given to that god who 
brought friction-fire (bore-fire) to man, and who is himself the 
personification of this fire, then it must be synonymous with ‘the 
borer.' ” 

23 TAl, p. 234. Rydberg (p. 593) spells it: ‘‘In the old Norse poetry Vedr (wether, 
ram) Heimdal and the Heimdal epithet hallinskidi, are synonymous.” 

24 A. Ohlmarks, Heividalls Horn und Odins Auge (1937), p. 144, makes the god 
a he-goat. That would not be bad, either, if he is right, since Capella, alpha 
Aurigae, “capricious” all over, whether male or female, has the name “asar bar- 
dagi = Fight of the Aesir” (Reuter, p. 279). Of Auriga-Erichthonios we shall hear 
more in the future. 

20 Instead of “head” ( kephalos ), Nonnos calls Aries mesomphaios , “midnavel,” 
of Olympus. 

26 It should be remarked that Snorri's identification ( Gylf . 13) of the bridge 
Bifroest with the rainbow made scholars rush to rescue a definitely regular phenom¬ 
enon from the hazardous existence which is allotted to a rainbow; they voted for 
the Milky Way instead. With this we are not likely to agree. See A. Ohlmarks, 
“Stellt die mythische Bifroest den Regenbogen oder die Milchstrasse dar?” Medd. 
Lunds Astron. Observ. (1941), ser. 11, no. no, and Reuter, p. 2S4, quoting addi¬ 
tional literature.

The Sibyl’s prophecy does not end with the catastrophes, but it 
moves from the tragic to the lydic mode, to sing of the dawning of 
the new age: 

Now do l see 

the Earth anew 

Rise all green 

fro 7 n the waves again . . . 

Then fields nnsowed 
bear ripetted fruit 
All ills grow better . 

Even if that generation of gods has perished, the younger ones re¬ 
main: Balder and Hoder, also the two sons of Thor, and Vidar the 
son of Odin. The House of the Wise Vanir is not affected as a 
whole, even if Freyr fell in battle. As the Vanir belong to a past age, 
this crisis apparently does not concern them. There is in fact a cer¬ 
tain perversely nightmarish or neurotic unreality about the tragedy 
as a whole. The Wolfs fetters were made of nothing but he was 
able to snap them only when the time came, when Odin and the 
Sun had to be devoured. The next instant, young Vidar kills the 
monster simply by thrusting his shoe down his throat (he has one 
shoe only, just like Jason). It is guilt and the ensuing chaos, more 
than actual forces, which dragged down the Establishment once 
the appointed time came, as decreed by fate and sounded on the 
Gjallarhorn. 

What happens after (or happened, or will happen sometime, for 
this myth is written in the future tense), is told in the Voluspa, but 
it is also amplified in Snorri’s Gylfaginning (53), a tale of a strange 
encounter of King Gylfi with the Aesir themselves, disguised as 
men, who do not reveal their identity but are willing to answer 
questions: “What happens when the whole world has burned up, 
the gods are dead, and all of mankind is gone? You have said earlier, 
that each human being would go on living in this or that world.” 
So it is, goes the answer, there are several worlds for the good and 
the bad. Then Gylfi asks : “Shall any gods be alive, and shall there 
be something of earth and heaven?” And the answer is: 










161 • The Twilight of the Gods 


“The earth rises up from the sea again, and is green and beautiful and 
things grow without sowing. Vidar and Vali are alive, for neither the 
sea nor the flames of Surt have hurt them and they dwell on the 
Eddyfield, where once stood Asgard. There come also the sons of 
Thor, Modi and Magni, and bring along his hammer. There come 
also Balder and Hoder from the other world. All sit down and con¬ 
verse together. They rehearse their runes and talk of events of old 
days. Then they find in the grass the golden tablets that the Aesir once 
played with. Two children of men will also be found safe from the 
great flames of Surt. Their names, Lif and Lifthrasir, and they feed 
on the morning dew and from this human pair will come a great 
population which will fill the earth. And strange to say, the sun, be¬ 
fore being devoured by Fenrir, will have borne a daughter, no less 
beautiful and going the same ways as her mother.” 

Then, all at once, concludes Snorri’s tale wryly, a thunderous 
cracking was heard from all sides, and when the King looked again, 
he found himself on the open plain and the great hall had vanished. 

The times and tenses are deliberately scrambled, but the state¬ 
ments, even if elliptical, are pregnant with ancient meaning. The 
rediscovery of the pieces of the game lying around in the grass, 
already told in the Voluspa, becomes clearer if one thinks of the 
Rigveda, where the gods themselves are said to go around like 
ayas, that is, casts of dice. 27 It becomes more understandable still 
when one considers that the name of the Indian world-ages fYuga) 
has been taken from the idiom of dicing. 28 But both data could be 
dismissed as unrevealing were it forgotten that in several kinds of 
“proto-chess”—to use an expression of J. Needham—board games 
and dicing were combined: the number of eyes thrown by the dice 
determined the figure which was to be moved. 29 That this very rule 
was also valid for tafl, the board game mentioned in the Voluspa, 
has been shown by A. G. van Hamel. 30 Thus, the dice forced the 
hands of the chess player—a game called ‘‘planetary battles” by the 
Indians, and in 16th-century Europe still termed “Celestial War, or

under a king; the king is Rudra.

Astrologer’s Game,” 31 whereas the Chinese chessboard shows the 
.Milky Wav dividing the two camps. Which goes to show that the 
Icelanders knew what they were talking about. 

Finally, there is one remarkable and disturbing coincidence from 
the same direction. It is known that in the final battle of the gods, 
the massed legions on the side of “order” are the dead warriors, the 
“Einherier” who once fell in combat on earth and who have been 
transferred by the Valkyries to reside with Odin in Valhalla—a 
theme much rehearsed in heroic poetry. On the last day, they issue 
forth to battle in martial array. Says the Grimnismal (23): “Five 
hundred gates and forty more—are in the mighty building of Wal- 
halla—eight hundred ‘Einherier’ come out of each one gate—on 
the time they go out on defence against the Wolf.” 

That makes 432,000 in all, a number of significance from of old. 

This number must have had a very ancient meaning, for it is also 
the number of syllables in the Rigveda. But it goes back to the basic 
figure 10,800, the number of stanzas in the Rigveda (40 syllables 
to a stanza) which, together with 108, occurs insistently in Indian 
tradition. 10,800 is also the number which has been given by Elera- 
clitus for the duration of the Aion, according to Censorinus ( De die 
natali 18), whereas Berossos made the Babylonian Great Year to 
last 432,000 years. Again, 10,800 is the number of bricks of the 
Indian fire-altar (Agnicayana) , 32 

“To quibble away such a coincidence,” remarks Schroder, “or 
to ascribe it to chance, is in my opinion to drive skepticism beyond 
its limits.” 33 Shall one add Angkor to the list? It has five gates, and 
to each of them leads a road, bridging over that water ditch which 
surrounds the whole place. Each of these roads is bordered by a row 
of huge stone figures, 108 per avenue, 54 on each side, altogether 
540 statues of Deva and Asura, and each row carries a huge Xaga

Horus and Seth in the act of drilling or churning. Horus has the head of a falcon; 
the head of Seth-Typhon shows the peculiar mixture of dog and ass which are 
characteristic of the so-called “Seth-beast.” This feature is continuously mislabeled 
the “uniting of the two countries,” whether Horus and Seth serve the churn or, 
as is more often the case, the so-called “Nile-Gods.”

The “incomparably mighty churn” of the Sea of Milk, as described in the Mahab- 
harata and Rcimayana. The heads of the deities on the right are the Asura, with 
unmistakable “Typhonian” characteristics. They stand for the same power as the 
Titans, the Turanians, and the people of Untamo, in short, the “family” of the 
bad uncle, among whom Seth is the oldest representative, pitted against Horus, 
the avenger of his father Osiris.

The simplified version of the Amritamanthana (or Churning of the Milky Ocean) 
still shows Mount Mandara used as a pivot or churning stick, resting on the tor¬ 
toise. And here, also, the head on the right has “Typhonian” features. 











































The Maya Codex Tro-Cortcsianus presents the same event in a different “projec¬ 
tion.” The illustration is harder to decode—as all Maya pictures arc—but the rope, 
the tortoise, and the churn (indicating an hourglass?) can be made out, and kin, 
the sign of the sun, glides along the serpent-rope.

serpent with nine heads. Only, they do not “carry” that serpent, 
they are shown to “pull” it, which indicates that these 540 statues 
are churning the Milky Ocean, represented (poorly, indeed) by the 
water ditch, 34 using Mount .Mandara as a churning staff, and Vasuki, 
the prince of the Nagas, as their drilling rope. (Just to prevent mis¬ 
understanding: Vasuki had been asked before, and had agreeably 
consented, and so had Vishnu’s tortoise avatar, who was going to 
serve as the fixed base for that “incomparably mighty churn,” and 
even the Milky Ocean itself had made it clear that it was whiling to 
be churned.) The whole of Angkor thus turns out to be a colossal 
model set up for “alternative motion” with true Hindu fantasy and 
incongruousness to counter the idea of a continuous one-way 
Precession from west to east. 

Now there is a last paragraph in the Gylfaginning, which is usu¬ 
ally considered an afterword, and its authorship is in doubt, for it is 
supposed that Snorri’s Edda was completed by Olaf Hvitaskald 
(d. 1259), Snorri’s nephew. In any case, this addition is somewhat 
out of the previous context, but it reinforces it: 

The Aesir now sat down to talk, and held their counsel, and remem¬ 
bered all the tales that were told to Gylfi. They gave the very same 
names that had been named before to the men and places that were 
there. This they did for the reason that, when a long time had elapsed, 
men should not doubt that those to whom the same names were 
given, were all identical. There was one who is called Thor, and he 
is Asa-Thor, the old. He is Oeku-Thor (Chariot-Thor) and to him 
are ascribed the great deeds by Hektor in Troy. 

As for the rebirth of the world, another “Twilight” comes to 
mind. It is in the Kuvndipo, a Polynesian cosmogonic myth from 
Hawaii. “Although we have the source of all things from chaos, it 
is a chaos which is simply the wreck and ruin of an earlier world.” 35

So sang an Oceanian Empedocles long ago. The poem was drawn 
from very old royal tradition, just as Virgil had drawn his from 
the story of the Gens Julia, for the true original line of Hawaiian 
kings was supposed to come from Kane, the Demiurge God of the 
Pacific. 

36 A. Bastian, Die Heilige Sage der Polynesier (1881), pp. 69—121. Along with 
Roland B. Dixon, who translated the last three lines above, we have relied on the 
German of Bastian, who was an outstanding authority on Polynesian culture and 
language. Modern experts have their own way. M. Beckwith ( Hawaiian Mythology 
[1940], p. 58) translates these lines thus: “At the time when the earth became hot/ 
At the time when the heavens turned about/At the time when the earth was 
darkened/To cause the moon to shine/The time of the rise of the Pleiades.” 

As concerns Makalii (Maori: Matariki; Micronesian and Melanesian dialects 
spell it Makarika , and the like), it is the name for the Pleiades, although more often 
we come across the phrase “the net of Makalii” (the correct form: Huihui-o- 
Matariki, i.e., the cluster of M.). The “person” Makalii, to whom this net belongs, 
as well as a second one (see p. 175) which we have reason to take for the Hyades, 
remains in the dark. See E. Tregear, The Maori-Polynesian Comparative Dic¬ 
tionary (1891) s.v. Matariki; N. B. Emerson, Unwritten Literature of Hawaii 
(1909), p. 17; M. W. Makemson, The Morning Star Rises: An Account of Poly¬ 
nesian Astronomy (1941), nos. 327, 380; Beckwith, p. 368; K. P. Emory, Tuamo- 
tuan Religious Structures and Ceremonies (1947), p. 61. For the Hyades and 
Pleiades as “celestial hunting nets” of the Chinese sphere, see G. Schlegel, VUrano- 
graphie Chinoise (1875; repr. 1967), pp. 365-70.
