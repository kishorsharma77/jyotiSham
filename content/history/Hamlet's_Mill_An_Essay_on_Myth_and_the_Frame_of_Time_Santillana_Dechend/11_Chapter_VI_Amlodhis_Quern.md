The stone which the builders refused 
is become the head stone of the corner. 

Psalm cxviii.2 2 ; Luke xx.17 

Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken, 
but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. 

Luke xx. 18 


w„ suggestive insights from other continents, it is time to 
take a fresh look at Shakespeare’s Gentle Prince, a cultivated, 
searching intellectual, the glass of fashion and the mold of form 
in the Danish Court, who was known once upon a time as a per¬ 
sonage of no ordinary power, of universal position, and, in the 
North, as the owner of a formidable mill. 

Well trained by the Church, Saxo could write excellent and 
ornate Latin, a rare achievement in his time. Though inspired by 
his patriotism to write the great chronicles of his own country, he 
was in Denmark an isolated if respectable fish in a small provincial 
pond. He remained oriented to the cultural pole of his times, which 
was Iceland. From there he had to draw most of his materials even 
if he helped to Danicize them, as we see in the story of Hamlet 
where all the features point toward a local dynastic story. But what 
he drew from Iceland were pieces of already “historical” lore. He 
could not draw, as did Snorri Sturluson, on the resources of a high 
position at the very center of Iceland’s rich bilingual culture, and 
on the experience of a wide-ranging and adventurous life. He could 
never have formed, like Snorri, the great project of reorganizing

the corpus of pagan and skaldic tradition inside an already Christian 
frame. Saxo seems to have known Icelandic fairly well, but not 
enough to understand the precious and convoluted language of 
ancient poetry. He was unsure of his bearings and simply arranged 
his story as best he could even though the name of Hamlet’s father, 
Orvendel (see appendix #2), should have been sufficient to warn 
him of its derivation from high myth. It is Snorri who provides a 
piece of decisive information: and it appears, as earlier noted, in 
chapter 16 of his Skaldskaparmal (“Poetical Diction”), a collection 
of kenningar , or turns of speech from ancient bards. It is couched 
in a language that even modern scholars can translate only tenta¬ 
tively. Appendix #5 contains a discussion of the many versions. 
The one quoted again here is that of Gollancz (p. xi), which ap¬ 
pears to be the most carefully translated: 

T’is said, sang Snaebjorn, that far out, off yonder ness, the Nine 
Maids of the Island Mill stir amain the host-cruel skerry-quern—they 
who in ages past ground Hamlet’s meal. The good chieftain furrows 
the hull’s lair with his ship’s beaked prow. Here the sea is called 
Amlodhi’s Mill. 

The Mill is thus not only very great and ancient, but it must also 
be central to the original Hamlet story. It reappears in the Skalds - 
kaparmal, where Snorri explains why a kenning for gold is “Fro- 
dhi’s meal.” 1 Frodhi appears in the chronicles, but his name is really 
an alias of Freyr, one of the great Vanir or Titans of Norse myth. 
But Snorri, who likes to give things a historical ring as befits his 
Christian upbringing, fixed his Frodhi to “the same time when Em¬ 
peror Augustus established peace in the whole world, and when 
Christ was born.” Under King Frodhi the general state of things 
was similar to that of the Golden Age, and it was called “Frodhi’s 
peace.” Saxo follows suit and attributes unsuspectingly a duration 
of thirty years to this peace. 2

Niedner (Thule 20 [1942]), pp. 195f. The other translators of Snorri’s Edda 
cannot agree on the manner of dividing the work into chapters, if they do not 
desist from doing so at all, as R. B. Anderson (1880), pp. 206-13, parts of whose 
translation we quote here. (Simrock [n.d.], pp. 89-93, niakes it chapter 63.)

Now Frodhi happened to be the owner of a huge mill, or quern, 
that no human strength could budge. Its name was Grotte, “the 
crusher.” We are not told how he got it, it just happened, as in a 
fairy tale. He traveled around looking for someone who could work 
it, and in Sweden he recruited two giant maidens, Fenja and Menja, 
who were able to work the Grotte. It was a magic mill, and Frodhi 
told them to grind out gold, peace and happiness. So they did. But 
Frodhi in his greed drove them night and day. He allowed them 
rest only for so long as it took to recite a certain verse. One night, 
when everybody else was sleeping, the giantess Menja in her anger 
stopped work, and sang a dire song. 

This obscure prophetic imprecation, as MuellenhofT has shown, 
is the oldest extant document of skaldic literature, antedating 
Snorri’s tale by far. It contains the biography of the grim sisters: 

Frode! you 'were not / Wary enough ,— 

You friend of men ,— / When maids you bought! 

At their strength you looked , / And at their fair faces , 

But you asked no questions / About their desce?it. 

Hard was Hrungner / And his father; 

Yet was Thjasse / Stronger than they , 

And Ide and Orner / Our friends , and 

The mountain-giants' brothers, / Who fostered us two. 

Not would Grotte have come / From the mountains gray , 

Nor this hard stone / Out from the earth; 

The maids of the mountain-giants / Would not thus be grinding 
If we two knew / Nothing of the mill. 

Such were our deeds / In former days , 

That we heroes brave / Were thought to be. 

With spears sharp / Heroes we pierced , 

So the gore did run / And our swords grew red. 

Now we are come / To the house of the king , 

No one us pities. / Bond-women are we. 

Dirt eats our feet / Our limbs are cold , 

The peace-giver we turn. / Hard it is at Frode's. 






89 • Amlodhi’s Quern 

Now hold shall the hands / The lances hard, 

The weapons bloody / Wake now , Frode! Wake now , Frode! 

If you woidd listen / To our songs ,— 

To sayings old. 

Fire l see burn / Zfojf <9/ burg ,— 

The war news are awake. / That is called warning. 

A host hither / Hastily approaches 
To burn the king's / L<?/Zy dwelling. 

No longer you will sit / Ow throne of Hleidra 
And ride o'er red / Rings and the mill. 

Now must we grind / TT/YA #// <?z/r might ; 

iV<? warmth will we get / From the blood of the slain. 

Now my father's daughter / Bravely turns the mill. 

The death of many / Men she sees. 

Now broke the large / Braces 'neath the mill ; —

Let us yet grind! / Yrsa's son 

Shall on Frode revenge / Half dan's death. 

He shall Yrsa's / Offspring be named, 

And yet Yrsa's brother. / Both of us know it. 

However obscure the prophecy, it brought its own fulfillment. 
The maidens ground out for Frodhi’s “a sudden host,” and that 
very day Mysingr, the Sea-King, landed and killed Frodhi. Mysingr 
(“son of the Mouse”—see appendix #6) loaded Grotte on his ship, 
and with him he also took the giantesses. He ordered them to grind 
again. But this time they ground out salt. 

“And at midnight they asked whether Mysingr were not weary 
of salt. He bade them grind longer. They had ground but a little 
while, when down sank the ship,” 

u the huge props flew off the bin, 
the iron rivets burst , 
the shaft tree shivered ,

the bin shot down, 

the massy mill-stone rent in twain ” 3 

“And from that time there has been a whirlpool in the sea where 
the water falls through the hole in the mill-stone. It was then that 
the sea became salt.” 

Here ends Snorri’s tale (appendix #7). Three fundamental and 
far-reaching themes have been set: the broken mill, the whirlpool, 
the salt. As for the curse of the miller women, it stands out alone 
like a megalith abandoned in the landscape. But surprisingly it can 
also be found, already looking strange, in the world of Homer, two 
thousand years before. 4 

It is the last night, in the Odyssey (20.103-19, Rouse trans.), 
which precedes the decisive confrontation. Odysseus has landed in 
Ithaca and is hiding under Athena’s magic spell which protects him 
from recognition. Just as in Snorri, everybody sleeps. Odysseus 
prays to Zeus to send him an encouraging sign before the great 
ordeal. 

Straightaway he thundered from shining Olympus, from on high 
from the place of the clouds; and goodly Odysseus was glad. More¬ 
over, a woman, a grinder at the mill, uttered a voice of omen from 
within the house hard by, where stood the mills of the shepherd of 
the people. At these handmills twelve women in all plied their task, 
making meal of barley and of wheat, the marrow of men. Now all the 
others were asleep, for they had ground out their task of grain, but 
one alone rested not yet, being the weakest of all. She now stayed her 
quern and spake a word, a sign to her Lord [epos phato sema anakti]. 
“Father Zeus, who rulest over gods and man, loudly hast thou thun¬ 
dered from the starry sky, yet nowhere is there a cloud to be seen: 
this is surely a portent thou art showing to some mortal. Fulfil now, I 
pray thee, even to miserable me, the word that I shall speak. May the 
wooers, on this day, for the last and latest time make their sweet 
feasting in the halls of Odysseus! They that have loosened my knees 
with cruel toil to grind their barley meal, mav they now sup their 
last!” 

“The weakest of all,” yet a giant figure in her own right. In the 
tight and shapely structure of the narrative, the episode is fitted

the two last lines from Brodeur (pp. i6zf.); otherwise, we followed the Anderson 
translation.

first pointed to the similarity of the episodes in Snorri’s Edda and in the Odyssey .

Kircher’s rather curious conception of the subterranean flow of rivers may have 
been evoked by Socrates’ last tale, but transposed to a strictly geological level. 
This drawing illustrates the subterranean connection between the whirlpool west

with art, yet it stands out like a cyclopean stone embedded in a 
house. There are many such things in Homer. 

Going back to Grotte, the name has an interesting story. It is 
still used today in Norwegian for the “axle-block,” the round 
block of wood which fills the hole in the millstone, and in which 
the end of the mill axle is fixed. In the Faroer as well as in the 
Shetland dialect, it stands for “the nave in the millstone.” The 
original Sanskrit nabhi covers both “nave” and “navel,” and this 
point should be kept in mind. In the story, it is obviously the nave 
that counts, for it created a hole when the mill tree sprang out of 
it, and the whirlpool formed in the hole. But “navel of the sea" was 
an ancient name for great whirlpools. Gollancz. with sound instinct, 
saw the connection right away: 

Indeed, one cannot help thinking of a possible reference to the mar¬ 
vellous Maelstroem, the greatest of all whirlpools, one of the wonders 
of the world; Umbilicus viaris according to the old geographers. 
l 'S ur S es mira bilis omnium totius orbis t err arum celeberrimus et maxi - 
mus" as Fr. Athanasius Kircher describes it in his fascinating folio 
“Mundus SubterraneusA According to Kircher, it was supposed that 
every whirlpool formed around a central rock: a great cavern opened 
beneath; down this cavern the water rushed; the whirling was pro¬ 
duced as in a basin emptying through a central hole. Kircher gives a 
curious picture of this theory, with special reference to the Mael¬ 
stroem . 5 

Clearly, the Mill is not a “chose transitory,” as lawyers say in 
their jargon. It must belong to the permanent equipment of the 
ancient universe. It recurs all the time, even if its connotations are 
rarely pleasant. From another corner of memory, there come the 
lines of Burns’ “John Barleycorn": 

They wasted o'er a scorching flame 
The marrozv of his bones 
But a miller used him worst of all 

For he crushed him between tivo stones. 

The mock tragedy of the yearly rural feast is part of the immense 
lore on fertility rites that Frazer has unfolded, with the ritual 
lamentations over the death of Tammuz, Adonis, the “Grain- 
Osiris” of Egypt; and no one would deny that the Tammuz festival 
5 I. Gollancz, Hamlet m Iceland (1S9S). p. xiv. 





Hamlet’s Mill • 92 

was a seasonal ritual celebrating the death and rebirth of vegetation. 
It has entered the commonplaces of our knowledge. But was this 
the original meaning? An irresistible preconception leads to the 
thought that when peasant rites are found tied to vegetation, there 
is the most elementary and primitive level of myth from which all 
others derive. It carries, too, its own moral tidings: “if the grain die 
not . . . ,” which led on to higher religious thought. 

In truly archaic cults, however, such as that of the Ssabians of 
Harran, reflected also in Ibn Wa’shijja’s “Book of Nabataean Agri¬ 
culture,” the death and grinding up of Tammuz is celebrated and 
lamented by the images of all the planetary gods gathered in the 
temple of the Sun suspended “between earth and heaven,” in the 
same way as they once cried and lamented over the passing of 
Jamshyd (or Jambushad as they then called him). This is a strange 
and unusual note, very un-agrarian, which deserves more careful 
study. 

But this leads back to the Norse myth of the Mill, and in fact 
to Snorri himself, who in his “Fooling of Gylfi” commented on a 
verse from the Vafthrudnismal which has been much discussed 
since. In this ancient poem, the end of Ymer is recounted. Ymer is 
the “initial” world giant from whose scattered body the world was 
made. Snorri states that Ymer’s blood caused a flood which 
drowned all giants except Bergelmer, who, with his wife, “betook 
himself upon his hidr and remained there, and from there the race 
of giants are descended.” The word hidr, as Snaebjorn said, stands 
for Mill. But in Vafthrudnismal (ch. 35), Odin asks the wise giant 
Vafthrudner of the oldest event he can think of, and gets this 
answer: “Countless ages ere the earth was shapen, Bergelmer was 
born. The first thing I remember—is when he a var \udr uni lagidr ” 
(appendix #8). Rydberg renders the words as “laid on a mill,” and 
understands them as “laid under a millstone.” Accordingly, he ex¬ 
plains Snaebjorn’s lidmeldr, which the great mill grinds, as “limb 
grist.” 6 As will appear later, there is a different interpretation to 
propose.

The problem, however, keeps turning up. In the Lokasenna 
(43^)7 Freyr, the original master of Grotte, is brought directly 
into action. The occasion is a banquet to which Aegir invited the 
gods. Loke uninvited made his appearance there to mix harm into 
the ale of the gods and to embitter their pleasure. But when Loke 
taunts Freyr, Byggver, the faithful retainer, becomes angry on his 
master’s behalf: 


“Had l the ancestry 

of In guitar Freyr 

and so honoured a seat 

know I would grind you 

finer than marrow, you evil crow, 

and crush you limb by limb.’’' 

To which Loke replies: 

! 

“What little boy is that 
whom l see wag his tail 
and eat like a parasite? 

Near Freyr's ears 
always you are 

and clatter 'neath the mill-stone." 

There are several more clues which hint that this mill upon which 
Bergelmer was “heaved” was a very distinct if unattractive mytho¬ 
logical feature, and they cannot be dealt with here. But if it should 
be remarked that Bergelmer was not in a state to produce offspring 
for the giants, if he really was laid under the millstone, there is 
also an example from Mexico, the “jewel-bone” or “sacrificial 
bone” which Xolotl or Quetzalcouatl procures from the “under¬ 
world,” bringing it to Tamoanchan (the so-called “House of de¬ 
scending”). There, the goddess Ciua couatl or Quilaztli grinds the 
precious bone on the grindstone, and the ground substance is put 
into the jewel bowl (chalchiuhapaztli ). Several gods maltreat 
themselves, making blood flow from their penises on the “meal." 
Out of this mixture mankind is fashioned.

These stories may not be in exquisite taste, but at least they are 
grotesque and contorted enough to rid us of reliance on the natural 
or intuitive understanding of artless tales sung by rustics dancing 
on the green. Real cosmological similes are anything but intuitive. 

One question remains from this discussion. Who was Snaebjorn, 
that dim figure, a few of whose lines have revealed so much? The 
scholars have gone searching, and have unearthed a veritable trea¬ 
sure in the ancient “Book of Iceland Settlements.” It links the poet 
with the first discovery of America. In that book, writes Gollancz: 

There is a vivid picture of a tenth-century Arctic adventurer, Snae¬ 
bjorn by name, who went on a perilous expedition to find the un¬ 
known land, “Gunnbjorn’s Reef,” after having wrought vengeance, 
as became a chivalrous gentleman of the period, on the murderer of a 
fair kinswoman. It is generally accepted, and there can be little doubt, 
that this Snaebjorn is identical with the poet Snaebjorn. 

His family history is not without interest. His great-grandfather, 
Eywind the Easterling, so called because he had come to the Hebrides 
from Sweden, married the daughter of Cearbhall, Lord of Ossory, 
who ruled as King of Dublin from 882 to 888, “one of the principal 
sovereigns of Europe at the time when Iceland was peopled by the 
noblemen and others who fled from the tyranny of Harold Harfagr.” 
Cearbhall was descended from Connla, the grandson of Crimhthann 
Cosgach, the victorious King of Ireland, who is said to have flourished 
about a century before the Christian era. Lann or Flann, the half- 
sister of Cearbhall, was married to Malachy I., King of Ireland, whose 
daughter Cearbhall had married. Flann was the mother of King 
Sionna and of the Lady Gormflaith, whom a cruel fate pursued; a 
king’s daughter, the wife of three kings, [she was] forced at last to 
beg for bread from door to door. About the date of Snaebjorn’s 
Arctic expedition (circa 980), his cousin, Ari Marson, is said to have 
landed on “White Man’s Land,” or “Great Iceland,”—that part of 
the coast of North America which extends from Chesapeake Bay, 
including North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida,—and 
became famous as one of the earliest discoverers of the New World. 7 

Thus Snaebjorn, as a member of an Irish royal family, typifies 
the mutual influence of Celtic and Scandinavian culture, between 
a.d. 800 and 1000, that influence which has been traced into the 
Eddie songs by Vigfusson in his Corpus Foeticuvi Boreale. The

Hamlet story itself typifies that exchange. For an earlier and simpler 
form of it may have been brought to Iceland from Ireland, whither 
the Vikings had originally taken the story of the great Orvendel’s 
son. 

This places Hamlet within the circle not only of Norse tradition, 
but of that prodigious treasury of archaic myth which is Celtic 
Ireland, from which many lines have been traced to the Near 
East. The universality of the Hamlet figure becomes more under¬ 
standable.
