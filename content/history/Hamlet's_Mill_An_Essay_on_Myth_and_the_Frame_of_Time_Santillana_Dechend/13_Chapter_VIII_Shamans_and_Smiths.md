Xn addition to the Sampo, there are many myths embedded in 
the KalevalcCs narrative sequence whose analysis would yield sur¬ 
prises. There was the contest of Vainamoinen with Youkahainen 
(see p. 97), a malevolent Lapp magician who seems to be his con¬ 
stant opponent. Youkahainen tries to overcome the ancient sage by 
asking cosmogonic riddles, but Vainamoinen “sings” the Lapp step 
by step into the bog up to his throat, and sings his magic formulae 
“backwards” to free him only when the Lapp has promised him 
Aino, his only sister. There was also the tale of Vainamoinen 
searching in the dead giant’s belly for three lost runes. These, unless 
they are treated as “just so stories,” look very much like “erratic 
boulders” deposited in Finland by the glacial movement of time. 
For once, it is possible to trace the archaic formation back to 
Egypt. 1 A young Egyptian called Setna (or Seton Chamwese) 
wanted to steal the magic book of Thot from the corpse of Nefer-ka 
Ptah, one of the great Egyptian gods, who was often portrayed as a 
mummy. Ptah, however, was awake and asked him: “Are you able 
to take this book away with the help of a knowing scribe, or do you 
want to overcome me at checkerboards? Will you play ‘Fifty- 
Two’?” Setna agreed, and the board with its “dogs” (pieces) being

brought up, Nefer-ka Ptah won a game, spoke a formula, laid the 
checkerboard upon Setna’s head and made him sink into the ground 
up to his hips. On the third time, he made him sink up to his ears; 
then Setna cried aloud for his brother, who saved him. 

There is also a Finnish folktale which repeats the well-known 
Babylonian story of Etana and the Eagle. 2 Here, instead of the 
King, it is the “Son of the Widow” (no reason is given for this 
epithet, which appears to belong to Perceval in the first line, but 
we find it again in later Masonic tradition) 3 who is taken up into 
the air by a griffin and sees the earth growing smaller and smaller 
under him. When the earth appears “no bigger than a pea” (analo¬ 
gous similes are to be found also in Etana), the griffin plunges 
straightaway to the bottom of the sea, where the hero finds a cer¬ 
tain object for which he had looked everywhere, and finally he is 
restored to land. This looks like the full story of what in the Baby¬ 
lonian cuneiform is interrupted halfway through because the tablet 
is broken off: it might be the first version of the legend of Alex¬ 
ander exploring the Three Realms. 

The anomalous position of Kullervo in the Kalevala remains a 
puzzle. Where Lonnrot put him in the sequence, he remains a 
displaced person, seeming to come, as was noted, from another 
age. There are many such incongruities. On the basis of the 
variants discovered, it has been boldly suggested that he was sup¬ 
posed to appear only after the departure of Vainamoinen—in fact, 
that he himself is the nameless Miraculous Child who compelled 
Vainamoinen to quit the scene, and that would be why the two 
never met. The people now understand the Child to be Christ him¬ 
self, but that is the normal transforming influence of the Church. 
The Child in Virgil’s Fourth Eclogue was also later thought to be 
Christ, and Virgil earned a reputation as a magician on the strength

3 Such words have long lives. At the height of Pickett’s Charge at Gettysburg, 
the first man over the wall was Gen. Armistead, who fell into the breach mortally 
wounded. To those who picked him up, the general kept repeating: “I am a Son 
of the Widow”—obviously the password of a secret military brotherhood that his 
captors did not understand, nor the historian either.

of his supposed prophecy. Actually, the mother says of Vaina- 
moinen’s and her illegitimate little son (50.199^): “He shall be a 
mighty conqueror, strong as even Vainamoinen.” This struck the 
English editor of the Kalevala, the more so as the baby is also called 
“the two-week-old Kaleva.” For Kullervo is both in Finnish and in 
Esthonian tradition the son of Kaleva—“Kalevanpoika” or “Kale- 
vipoeg”—much more explicitly than the other heroes, who are 
“sons”, only generically. It would fit into the mythical picture, for 
reasons which will soon be evident, to have a time-bound tragic 
avatar of Vainamoinen, following upon the timeless sage. 

But then, who is Kaleva- He is a mysterious entity that shines 
by his absence, and yet is the eponymous presence through the 
whole poem. The connotation of “giant” is attached to him: in some 
of the Finnish versions of the Old Testament, the gigantic Rephaim 
and Enakim are called “children of Kaleva.” But there are many 
reasons for understanding the word as smith. 4 Kaleva might be a 
smith even more primeval than Ilmarinen. There is a strange line 
in the spell describing the origin of iron: “Poor Iron, man Kaleva, 
at that time thou wast neither great nor small.” In any case, the 
current notion that Kaleva is a “personification” of Finland, a sort 
of Britannia with her trident, can be dismissed as unserious. Those 
were no times for rhetorical figures. Kaleva remains for the present 
a significant void. But Setala notes that the Russian by Uni, the 
close neighbors of the Esthonian runes, sing the feats of Koly- 
vanovic, the son of Kolyvan, and say next to nothing of Kolyvan 
himself. 

The Russian texts give the full name as Samson Kolyvanovic, 
just as in Finland it is Kullervo Kalevanpoika. Here perhaps by 
chance a name turns up which runs like a barely visible thread 
through the whole tradition. We have Samson in the Kalevala right 
in the first rune; his name is Sampsa Pellervoinen, who “sows the 
trees” and also helps Vainamoinen to cut them down. 0 His name, 

4 E. N. Setala, “Kullervo-Hamlet,” FUF 7 (1907), p. 249. See also K. Krohn, 
Kalevalastttdien i. Einleitung (19:4), pp. 93-101. 

5 Krohn suggests deriving Sampsa from Sampo. Comparetti would like it the 
other way around. Neither is convinced or convincing, but they both show that 
the name of Samson is a rarity which has to be accounted for.

“the man of the field” or the “earth-begotten,” shows him to be 
a rural deity, which might translate into the Greek Triptolemus, or 
the Etruscan Aruns Velthymnus. One can no longer tell what his 
role was in the original order of the poem. It is enough that he is 
there. The lore of the Mill begins to extend beyond reach. It will be 
no surprise, then, to find Lykophron, the master mythologist, speak¬ 
ing of Zeus the Miller (435). With it, paradoxically, goes again 
the name of Mylinos, “Miller,” given to the leader of the Battle of 
the Giants against the Gods. The struggle was seen obviously as one 
for the control of the Mill of Heaven. 

It is, then, maybe not by chance that the name of Samson appears 
in the Far North. For Samson himself, Samson Agonistes, should 
have a place of honor among the giant Heroes of the Mill. He is in 
fact the first one in our literature. We are told (Judges xvi.21) how 
he ground away, “eyeless in Gaza, at the mill, with slaves,” until 
his cruel captors unbound him to “make sport” for them in their 
temple, and with his last strength he took hold of the middle pillars 
and brought the temple crushing down on the heads of the Philis¬ 
tines. Like Menja, he had taken his revenge. 

But Samson leads beyond the confines of this topic into a world¬ 
wide context. He brings more abstruse concepts into play. He had 
better be reserved for the next chapter. 

Now, at the end of the strange story of the Sampo, one is en¬ 
titled to ask: does all this make much sense by itself? Is it relevant 
at all beyond literary history? Comparetti, the great old scholar 
who in the last century tackled the difficult study of Finnish poetry, 
set himself a neat and classic philological question. Would it help 
us to understand the birth of the Homeric poems? Yes, he says. Yet 
he admits that the Homeric question remains open. In other words, 
the famous “commission of Orphic and Pythagorean experts set up 
by Pisistratus to collect the scattered rhapsodies” can hardly have 
produced by itself any more than Lonnrot could, such works as 
the Iliad and the Odyssey. Hence in conclusion there must still have 
been a Homer. Which goes to show that the conventional idea of 
epic genius ends up in mystery even for the comparative philologist. 
But Comparetti is prompt to point out that those experts were no

117 • Shamans and Smiths 

scholars in today’s sense, belonging as they did to a period when 
myth, poetry and intellectual creation were all one. 

It might have been better perhaps to take the question from the 
other end. Supposing that Lonnrot had been himself some kind of 
“Orphic and Pythagorean” in the old sense, might he not have pro¬ 
duced a better reconstruction than the—surely intelligent—stitch¬ 
ing together to which he had to limit himself? Was he not hampered 
by his ignorance of the archaic background? Firdausi did actually 
know the astrological doctrines through which his scattered sources 
made coherent sense, and this is undoubtedly what allowed him to 
weld his Shahnama into a real whole. Lonnrot was not, but the 
“short songs” of Finnish peasant tradition were too far removed 
from the original thought for anyone to recapture it. His successors 
who unearthed a bewildering number of variants to every single 
rune have left the confusion intact. Instead of forcing the bulky 
piece into an arbitrary whole, the Finnish Folklore Fellows (F. F. 
for short) have taken up comparative mythology, the only means 
by which order can be established eventually. 

As concerns Homer and the presupposed Homeric rhapsodies, 
this is dangerous territory. Not so much because Homer belongs in 
fee simple to the redoubtable guild of Homeric scholars—Compa- 
retti as a respectable member of the guild could afford deviations— 
but essentially because it is not fitting to try to reduce to a “scheme” 
what remains a prodigious and subtle work of art, the limpidity and 
immediacy of which should not be spoiled. It is unfortunately a 
common prejudice that to work out high theoretical allusions con¬ 
tained in the text reduces the text to an irrelevant conundrum, 
whereas, for instance, the Catalogue of Ships studied literally re¬ 
veals hidden beauties to the reader. It is enough to suggest here that 
Homer found pre-existent materials at hand, squared blocks and 
well-cut ashlars, which he transformed into poetry. One of those 
prefabricated pieces, the Curse of the Miller Woman, is located 
in chapter VI, and there is more such evidence to come. Homer’s 
craft lay really in reshaping and humanizing these materials so well 
that they became inconspicuous. In the case of the Greek tragedies 
more is known, thanks to Apollodorus. His “Library” of myths, 




Hamlet’s Mill • 118 


supplemented by Frazer’s wonderful notes, shows that the “Li¬ 
brary” provided the “book” for every tragedy, those that we have 
and those that are lost, those written and those never written. Yet it 
took an Aeschylus or a Sophocles to transform the meaning, to 
make out of it a work of art. 

Much closer to hand, and better known, are the sources of the 
Divine Comedy —history, philosophy and myth, measures and inter¬ 
vals—which provide a virtually complete structure without gaps. 
Yet because of this, Dante is all the more a true creator. Clearly, it 
is the very idea of “poet,” poietes, which has to be redefined in 
moving closer to traditional sources. Veteres docti poetae as Ovid 
said, himself not the least of them. “Learned” is the key word, not 
in theoretical tropes and allegories, but in the living substances of 
mythical doctrine. 

But here again common usage is misleading. Today, a learned 
man is usually one who understands what it is all about. Dante was 
certainly one. But was it so in remote ages? There is reason to doubt 
it. An esoteric doctrine, as defined by Aristotle, is one which is 
learned long before being understood. Much of the education of 
Chinese scholars was until very recently along those lines. Under¬ 
standing remained something apart. It might never come at all, and 
at best would come when the learning was complete. There were 
other ways. 

One can give an extreme case from Rome. Athenaeus 6 says that 
there was a much-applauded mime, Memphis by name, who in a 
brief dance was said to convey faultlessly the whole essence of the 
Pythagorean doctrine. It is not said that he understood it: he may 
have had an inkling, and the rest was his extraordinarily sharpened 
sense of expression. He had, so to speak, a morphological under¬ 
standing that he could only express in action. His public understood 
surely no more than he: but they would be strict and unforgiving 
judges. Dictum sapienti sat, the wise would say. But here even the 
one word was missing. His spectators would shout deliriously none¬ 
theless, in their own demotic language: “I dig you, Jack.” And for

the slightest lapse from the exact form, they were ready with eggs 
and overripe tomatoes. Here is a case of true communication which 
does not need understanding. It takes place only through the form, 
morphe. In mystery rites there were things which “could not be 
said” ( arrheta ) but could only be acted out. 

Such happenings must be kept in mind when trying to determine 
how well the poet understood the material handed on to him. Cre¬ 
ative misunderstanding may have been of the essence of his “free¬ 
dom”: but strict respect was there nonetheless. The rune of the 
“origin of iron” (the ninth of the Kalevala) was incomprehensible 
to the laulaja, yet he knew he had to recite this “deep origin” to 
control the lethal powers of cold iron. Magic and mantic implica¬ 
tions were present always in the grim business of the smith, as they 
were in the high business of the poet. Understanding lay beyond 
them. 

Every era, of course, has freely invented its own ballads, ro¬ 
mances, songs and fables to entertain it. That is another matter. 
This concerns the poet, poietes, as he was understood in early times. 
There was an original complex of meaning which comprised the 
words poet, vates, prophet, seer. Every knowledge and law, Vico 
wrote with a flash of genius two centuries ago, must once upon a 
time have been “serious poetry,” poesia seriosa. It is in this sense 
that Aristotle in a sophisticated age still refers respectfully to “the 
grave testimony of [early] poets.” 

Now that documents of the earliest ages of writing are available, 
one is struck with a wholly unexpected feature. Those first prede¬ 
cessors of ours, instead of indulging their whims with childlike 
freedom, behave like worried and doubting commentators: they 
always try an exegesis of a dimly understood tradition. They move 
among technical terms whose meaning is half lost to them, they deal 
with words which appear on this earliest horizon already “tottering 
with age” as J. H. Breasted says, words soon to vanish from our 
ken. Long before poetry can begin, there were generations of 
strange scholiasts. 

The experts have noted the uncertainty prevailing in the succes¬ 
sors of old texts, the attempts in them to establish correct names 







Hamlet’s Mill • 


120 


and their significance from obsolete formulas and ideograms. 
S. Schott, dealing with early star lists of Egypt, 7 points to the per¬ 
plexity of later generations concerning the names of constellations, 
even those of the “greatest gods of the Decans, Orion and Sothis, 
who in Ancient Egyptian are called by the names of old hiero¬ 
glyphs, without anybody knowing, in historical times, what these 
hieroglyphs had meant, once upon a time. During the whole long 
history of these names we meet attempts at interpretation.” This 
last sentence goes for every ancient text, not only for the names 
contained therein: there is no end of commentaries on the Pyramid 
Texts, the Coffin Texts and the Book of the Dead, 8 on the Rigveda, 
the I-Ging, just as on the Old Testament. 9 W. von Soden regrets 
that we depend on the documents of the “Renaissance of Sumerian 
culture” (around 2100 b.c.) instead of having the real, old material 
at our disposal. 10 The mere fact that Sumerian was the language of 
the educated Babylonian and Assyrian, the existence of the many 
Sumerian-Akkadian “dictionaries” and the numerous translations 
of the Gilgamesh epic betray the activity of several academies re¬ 
sponsible for the officially recognized text editions. One can almost 
see the scholars puzzling and frowning over the texts. And in 
Mexico it was the same. In Chimalpahin’s Memorial Breve we find 
notes such as “In the year ‘5-house’ certain old men explained some 
pictographs to the effect that king Hueymac of Tollan [the mythi¬ 
cal Golden Age city] had died.” 11 This took place before the com¬ 
ing of the Spaniards. The Greek “Renaissance,” no less than those 
of the previous millennia in the Near East, was the result of such 
an antiquarian effort. Hesiod still bears the mark of it. 

These few notions should be present in any ideas about “trans¬ 
mission.” The word need in no way imply “understanding” on

the part of those who transmit, and this is true from early ages 
down to contemporary minstrels. As has been pointed out, it is easy 
to slip into ordinary literary history if the origins are not seriously 
investigated. Does the tale of the Sampo have a wider interest than 
this? A few handsome cosmic motifs scattered through the tale of 
magic might still have reached Finland through the “corridors of 
Time” from other cultures without any meaning attached. In short, 
it might all be “folk poetry” in the usual sense. 

The editors of the Kalevala themselves insistently described the 
background as “shamanistic,” by which they simply understood 
some kind of primitive “religion.” It corresponded in their minds 
to primeval, instinctive magic, to be found in all five continents, 
associated with the tribal “medicine man.” Then came Frazer to 
introduce the cleavage between “magic” and “religion” as distinct 
forms, to complicate matters further. Shamanism remained until 
recently a catchword of an uncertain sort—a portmanteau term for 
specialists, a vague notion for the public, of the kind that gives one 
the pleasant impression of understanding what it is all about—like 
that other too-famous term, mana. One of the present authors is 
willing to admit ruefully that he once stressed the link of Pytha¬ 
goras and Epimenides with Thracian shamans, with no more 
thought than to show that there was much in them of the ageless 
medicine man. 12 This was several years ago, and it seemed to cor¬ 
respond to the state of the art. It is no longer so. To have uncovered 
the inadmissibility of the general usage of the term is the merit of 
Laszlo Vajda’s short but dense and logical study on the subject. 13 
Vajda has shown that no historical verdict based on such generali¬ 
ties is valid. It is inadmissible to reduce shamanism to memories of 
Eskimo angekoks or to a “technique of induced ecstasy,” or to 
derive such phenomena from the Asiatic North where, undeniably, 
this particular kind of queerness is fostered. 

“Shaman” is a Tungusian word. Shamanism has its epicenter in 
Ural-Altaic Asia, but it is a very complex phenomenon of culture

biicher 31 (1959), pp. 456-85.

which can be explained neither by psychologists nor by sociologists, 
but only by way of historical ethnology. To put it in a few words, 
a shaman is elected by spirits, meaning that he cannot choose his 
profession. Epileptics and mentally unhinged persons are obvious 
privileged candidates. Once elected, the future shaman goes to 
“school.” Older shamans teach him his trade, and only after the 
concluding ceremony of his education is he accepted. This is, so 
to speak, the visible part of his education. The real shamanistic ini¬ 
tiation of the soul happens in the world of spirits—while his body 
lies unconscious in his tent for days—who dismember the candidate 
in the most thorough and drastic manner and sew him together 
afterwards with iron wire, or reforge him, so that he becomes a 
new being capable of feats which go beyond the human. The duties 
of a shaman are to heal diseases which are caused by hostile spirits 
who have entered the body of the patient, or which occur because 
the soul has left the body and cannot find the way back. Often 
the shaman is responsible for guiding the souls of the deceased to 
the abode of the dead, as he also escorts the souls of sacrificed ani¬ 
mals to the sky. His help is needed, too, when the hunting season 
is bad; he must find out where the game is. In order to find out all 
the things which he is expected to know, the shaman has to ascend 
to the highest sky to get the information from his god—or go into 
the underworld. On his way he has to fight hostile spirits, and/or 
rival shamans, and tremendous duels are fought. Both combatants 
have with them their helping spirits in animal form, and much 
shape-shifting takes place. In fact, these fantastic duels form the 
bulk of shamanistic stories. The last echoes are the so-called “magic- 
flights” in fairy tales. The shaman’s soul ascends to the sky when he 
is in a state of ecstasy; in order to get into this state, he needs his 
drum which serves him as a “horse,” the drumstick as a “whip.” 14 
Now, the “frame” within which the shaman proper acts, that is, the 

14 The shamans also use as a “main artery” a stream flowing through all levels of 
the sky, and they identify it with the Yenissei—a conception which will become 
clearer at a later point of this inquiry. (U. Holmberg, Finno-Ugric and Siberian 
Mythology [1964], pp. 307^).

world conception of Ural-Altaic shamanism, has been successfully 
traced back to India (under its Hinduistic and Buddhistic aspects, 
including Tibetan Lamaism and Bon-po) as well as to Iran. When 
reading Radloff’s many volumes, one runs into insufficiently dis¬ 
guised Bodhisatvas at every corner (Manjirae = Alanjusri; Mait- 
erae, or Maidere = Maitreya, etc.), but the best organized material 
has been provided by Uno Holmberg (Uno Harva), 15 who has been 
quoted here and will be quoted frequently. 

-This world conception, however, with its three “domains,” with 
seven or nine skies, one above the other, and with corresponding 
“underworlds,” with the “world-pillar” running through the cen¬ 
ter of the whole system, crowned by the “north Nail,” or “World 
Nail” (Polaris), goes farther back than Indian and Iranian culture, 
namely to the most ancient Near East, whence India and Iran de¬ 
rived their idea of a “cosmos”—a cosmos being in itself by no 
means an obvious assumption. The shaman climbing the “stairs” or 
notches of his post or tree, pretending that his soul ascends at the 
same time to the highest sky, does the very same thing as the Meso¬ 
potamian priest did when mounting to the top of his seven-storied 
pyramid, the ziqqurat, representing the planetary spheres. 16 

15 See the bibliography. 

16 Nine skies, instead of seven, within the sphere of fixed stars, result from the 
habit of including among the planets the (invisible) “head” and “tail” of the 
“Dragon,” which is to say the lunar nodes, conjunctions or oppositions in the 
vicinity of which cause the eclipses of Sun and Moon; the revolution of these 
“draconitic points” is c. i 8 J 4 years. This notion, upheld in medieval Islamic astrol¬ 
ogy, is Indian, but apparently not of Indian origin, as will come out eventually. 
Reuter, Germanische Hivmielskimde (1934), pp. 29iff., thinks that the Teutonic 
idea of nine planets including the draconitic points goes back to the common “Ur- 
zeit” of Indo-Europeans, and refers to Luise Troje, Die 13 and 12 im Traktat Pelliot 
(1925), pp. yf., 25, 149E Even if the “Dragon” should go back to this time, we do 
not take the Indo-Europeans, whether united or not, for the inventors of this idea. 
As concerns Islamic and Indian tradition, see the most thorough and thoughtful 
inquiries by Willy Hartner, “The Pseudoplanetary Nodes of the Moon’s Orbit in 
Hindu and Islamic Iconographies,” in Ars Islamica $ (1938), Pt. 1; Le Frobleme de 
la planete Ka’id (1955); “Zur Astrologischen Symbolik des ‘Wade Cup’,” in Fest¬ 
schrift Kiichnel (1959), pp. 234-43. Whether we shall find the time to deal in 
the appropriate form with the tripartite Universe in this essay remains doubtful. 
This much can be safely stated: it goes back to “The Ways of Anu, Enlil, and 
Ea” in Babylonian astronomy.

From the majestic temple at Borobudur in Java to the graceful 
stupas which dot the Indian landscape, stretches a schematized re¬ 
minder of the seven heavens, the seven notches, the seven levels. 
Says Uno Holmberg: “This pattern of seven levels can hardly be 
imagined as the invention of Turko-Tatar populations. To the in¬ 
vestigator, the origin of the Gods ruling those various levels is no 
mystery, for they point clearly to the planetary gods of Babylon, 
which already in their far-away point of origin, ruled over seven 
superposed starry circles.” 17 This was also the considered conclusion, 
years ago, of Paul Mus. To have taken the conception of several 
skies and underworlds as natural, ergo primitive, was a grievous 
blunder which distorted the historical outlook of the last two cen¬ 
turies. It stems from the fact that philologists and Orientalists have 
lost all contact with astronomical imagination, or even the funda¬ 
mentals of astronomy. When they find something which savors 
undeniably of astronomical lore, they find a way to label it under 
“prelogical thought” or the like. 

But even apart from the celestial “ladder,” and the sky-travel of 
the shaman’s soul, a close look at shamanistic items always discloses 
very ancient patterns. For instance, the drum, the most powerful 
device of the shaman, representing the Universe in a specific way, 
is the unmistakable grandchild of the bronze lilissu drum of the 
Mesopotamian Kalu-priest (responsible for music, and serving the 
god Enki/Ea). 18 The cover of the lilissu drum must come from a 
black bull, “which represents Taurus in heaven,” says Thureau- 
Dangin. 19 Going further, W. F. Albright and P. E. Dumont 20

(1926), p. 210 s.v. “sugugalu, ‘the hide of the great bull,’ an emblem of Anu.” We 
might point, once more, to the figure of speech used by Petronius’ Trimalchio, 
who, talking of the month of May, states: “Totus coelus taurulus fiat” (“the whole 
heaven turns into a little bull”).

compared the sacrifice of the Mesopotamian bull, the hide of which 
was to cover the lilissu drum, with the Indian Ashvamedha, a huge 
horse sacrifice which only the most successful king (always a 
Kshatrya) could afford. They found that the Indian horse must 
have the Krittika, the Pleiades, on his forehead, and this too, accord¬ 
ing to Albright, is what the Akkadian text prescribes concerning 
the bull. This should be enough to indicate the level of phenomena 
brought into play. 

The striking of the drum covered with that specific bull hide was 
meant as a contact with heaven at its most significant point, and in 
the Age of Taurus (c. 4000-2000 b.c.) this was also explicitly said 
to represent i\nu, now casually identified as “God of Heaven.” But 
Anu was a far more exact entity. In cuneiform script, Anu is writ¬ 
ten with one wedge, which stands for the number 1 and also for 60 
in the sexagesimal system (the Pythagoreans would have said, he 
stands for the One and the Decad). All this does not mean some 
symbolic or mystical, least of all magical quality or quantity, but 
the fundamental time measure of celestial events (that is, motions). 21 
Striking the drum was to involve (this time, yes, magically) the 
essential Time and Place in heaven. 

It is not clear whether or not the Siberian shamans were still 
aware of this past. The amount of highly relevant star lore collected 
by Holmberg, and the innumerable figures of definitely astronomi¬ 
cal character found on shamanistic drums could very well allow 
for much more insight than the ethnologists assume, but this is 
irrelevant at this point. What is plain and relevant is that the Si¬ 
berian shamans did not invent the zodiac, and all that goes with it. 

There is no need for a detailed inspection of Chinese mythical 
drums, merely a few lines from an “Ocean of Stories”: 

In the Eastern Sea, there is to be found an animal which looks like an 

ox. Its appearance is green, and it has no horns. It has one foot only. 

When it moves into the water or out of it, it causes wind or rain. Its 

21 Compare the sexagesimal round of days in customary notation of the oracle 
bones of Shang China, ijth century b.c., about which Needham states that it is 
“probably an example of Babylonian influence on China” (Science and Civilisation 
in China [1962], vol. 4, Pt. 1, p. 181).

shining is similar to that of the sun and the moon. The noise it makes 

is like the thunder. Its name is K’uci. The great Huang-ti, having 

captured it, made a drum out of its skin. 22 

This looks prima facie like the description of an ancient case of 
delirium tremens, but the context makes it sober enough. This is a 
kind of Unnatural Natural History which has small regard for living 
species, but deals with events from another realm. The One-Legged 
Being, in particular, can be followed through many appearances 
beginning with the Hunrakan of the Mayas, whose very name 
means “one-leg.” From it comes our “hurricane,” so there is no 
wonder that he disposes of wind, rain, thunder and lightning in 
lavish amounts. But he is not for all that a mere weather god, since 
he is one aspect of Tezcatlipoca himself, and the true original One- 
Leg that looks down from the starry sky—but his name is not 
appropriate yet. 

And so back by unexpected ways to mythical drums and their 
conceivable use. A lot more might be found by exploring that 
incredible storehouse of archaic thought miraculously preserved 
among the Mande peoples of West Sudan. 23 In the large and com¬ 
plicated creation myth of the Mande, there are two drums. The 
first was brought down from heaven by the bardic ancestor, shortly 
after the Ark (with the eight twin-ancestors) had landed on the 
primeval field. This drum was made from Faro’s skull and was 
used for producing rain. (The experts style Faro usually “le Moni- 

22 M. Granet, Danses et legendes de la Chine ancienne (1959), p. 509. Such 
imagery is by no means unique. E.g., the Taittiriya Sanhita says: “The pressing 
stone [of the Soma-press] is the penis of the sacrificial horse, Soma is his seed; 
when he opens his mouth, he causes lightning, when he shivers, it thunders, when 
he urinates, it rains” (7.5.25.2 — Shatapatha Brahmana /0.6.4.1 — Brihad Aranyaka 
Upanishad /.1; see R. Pischel and K. F. Geldner, Vedische Studien , vol. /, p. 86). 

It will come out later why it is important to supplement these strange utterances 
with the statement of the Shatapatha Brahmana: “In the water having its origin 
is the horse,” which sounds ever so inconspicuous until E. Sieg ( Die Sagen- 
stoffe des Rigveda, p. 98) obliges the non-Sanskritist by giving the Sanskrit words 
in transcription, i.e., “tfprwyanir va asvah”; apsu is something more specific than 
just water; it is, in fact, the very same topos as the Babylonian apsu (Sumerian: 
abzu ). 

23 In East Africa, the drum occupied the place that the Tabernacle had in the 
Old Testament, as Harald von Sicard has shown in Ngoma Lungundu: Eme afri- 
kanische Bundeslade (1952).

teur,” thus avoiding mislabeling him as culture hero, savior or god.) 
The first sanctuary was built, and the “First Word” revealed (30 
words there were) to mankind through the mouth of one of the 
twin-ancestors, who “talked the whole night, ceasing only when 
he saw the sun and Sirius rising at the same time.” When the “Second 
Word” was to be revealed (consisting of 50 words this time), and 
again connected with the heliacal rising of Sirius, the ancestor “de¬ 
cided to sacrifice in the sanctuary on the hill the first twins of mixed 
sex. He asked the bard to make an arm-drum with the skin of the 
twins. 24 The tree, from which he carved the drum, grew on the hill 
and symbolized Faro’s only leg.” 25 

Here again are important one-legged characters, of whom there 
are a bewildering number with various functions all over the world. 
It is not necessary to enter that jungle, except to note that the tem¬ 
porary mock-king of Siam, who was set up for yearly expiatory 
ceremonies, also had to stand on one leg upon a golden dais during 
all the coronation ceremonies, and he had the fine-sounding title of 
“Lord of the Celestial Armies.” 26 The Chinese K’uei is then no iso¬ 
lated character. The Chinese myth is more explicit than the others 
and becomes more understandable because the Chinese were ex¬ 
tremely sky-conscious. Their sinful monsters are thrown into pits 
or banished to strange mountain regions for the sin of having upset 
the calendar. 

As for K’uei himself, engagingly introduced as a green oxlike crea¬ 
ture of the Eastern Sea, he will grow more bewildering as his nature 
unfolds. Marcel Granet writes that the Emperor Shun made K’uei 
“master of music”—actually ordered no less a power than the 
Sun (Chong-li) to fetch him from the bush and bring him to 
court, because K’uei alone had the talent to bring into harmony 

24 It is an hourglass-shaped drum, with two skins, said “to recall the two geo¬ 
graphic areas, Kaba and Akka, and the narrow central part of the drum is the 
river itself [Niger] and hence Faro’s journey.”

the six pipes and the seven inodes, and Shun, who wanted to bring 
peace to the empire, stood by the opinion that “music is the essence 
of heaven and earth.” 27 K’uei also could cause the “hundred animals” 
to dance by touching the musical stone, and he helped Yii the 
Great, that indefatigable earth-mover among the Five First Em¬ 
perors, to accomplish his labor of regulating the “rivers.” And it 
turns out that he was not only Master of the Dance, but Master of 
the Forge as well. He must have been a remarkable companion for 
Yii the Great, whose dancing pattern (the Step of Yii) “per¬ 
formed” the Big Dipper. 28 

Enough of drums, and of their shamanic use. They have at least 
ceased to seem like tribal tom-toms. They are connected with time, 
rhythm and motion in heaven. 

Moving now to another great theme, in fact a very great one, it 
is possible to trace back the significance of the blacksmith in Asiatic 
shamanism, particularly the celestial blacksmith who is the legiti¬ 
mate heir to the divine “archi-tekton” of the cosmos. Several repre¬ 
sentatives of this type, whom we call Deus Faber, still have both 
functions, being architects and smiths at the same time, e.g., the 
Greek Hephaistos, who builds the starry houses for the gods and 
forges masterworks, and the Koshar-wa-Hasis of Ras Shamra, who 
builds Baal’s palace and forges masterworks also. 

The Yakuts claim: “Smith and Shaman come from the same 
nest,” and they add: “the Smith is the older brother of the Sha¬ 
man,” 29 which might be valid also for Vainamoinen, coupled with 
Ilmarinen, who is said to have “hammered together the roof of the 
sky.” It is the primeval Smith who made the Sampo, as we know, 
and forged sky and luminaries in Esthonia. It is no idle fancy that 
the representative of the celestial smith, the King, is himself fre¬ 
quently titled “Smith.” Jenghiz Khan had the title “Smith” 30 and

terrestrial blacksmith: the many iron pieces which belong to the costume of a 
shaman can be forged only by a blacksmith of the 9th generation, i.e., eight of his 
direct ancestors must have been in the profession. A smith who dared forge a 
shamanistic outfit without having those ancestors would be torn by bird-spirits.

the standard of the Persian Empire was the stylized leather apron 
of the Smith Kavag (appendix #n). The Chinese mythical em¬ 
perors Huang-ti and Yii are such unmistakable smiths that Marcel 
Granet drew historic-sociological conclusions all the way, forget¬ 
ting the while that Huang-ti, the Yellow Emperor, is acknowl¬ 
edged to be Saturn. And just as the Persian Shahs held their royal 
jubilee festival after having reigned thirty years, which is the Satur¬ 
nian revolution, so the Egyptian Pharaoh also celebrated his jubilee 
after thirty years, true to the “inventor” of this festival, Ptah, who 
is the Egyptian Saturn, and also Deus Faber. It was necessary to 
enter this subject in depth abruptly and lay stress on these few 
selected data, because otherwise the charming and harmless-looking 
Finnish runes would not be seen for what they are, the badly dam¬ 
aged fragments of a once whole and “multicolored cover.” It does 
no harm to stamp Vainamoinen a “shaman” as long as one remains 
aware of the background of shamanism. In fact, there is again a 
vision in depth from seeing that Vainamoinen has discarded the 
drum which remains the one instrument of his Lapp cousins; he has 
created the harp, and this means that he must be seen as the Orpheus 
of the North. 

Last survivals are not easily recognized. It needs experience, and 
it cannot be expected that an unsuspecting reader of “folk poetry” 
would spot well-known divine characters when they come his way 
clad in Longfellow’s meter. For instance, in reading Kalevala 
y.ioyff., it is not easy to discover the mighty Iranian God of Time, 
Zurvan akarana, who is portrayed as standing upon the world egg, 
carrying in his hands the tools of the architect: 

Then was born smith Ilmarinen 
Thus was born and thus was nurtured 
Born upon a hill of charcoal, 

Reared upon a plain of charcoal, 

In his hands a copper hammer, 

And his little pincers likewise. 

Ilmari was born at night time, 

And at day he built his smithy. 

Since Christendom was very successful in destroying old traditions, 
Altaic and Siberian survivals are often found in far better shape

than Finnish runes, but even the Lapps still speak of “Waralden ol- 
niay, ‘World Man’ . . . and this is the same as Saturnus.” 31 Nor are 
Jupiter and Mars absent, the former being called Idora Galles 
(Thorkarl), the latter Bieka Galles, the “Wind Man.” 32 Voguls, 
Yakuts and Mongols tell of God’s seven sons, or seven gods (or 
nine), among whom are a “Scribe Man,” 33 and a “Man observing the 
World.” The latter has been compared straightaway with Kullervo 
by Karl Kerenyi, 34 who claims his name to be the literal translation 
of Avalokiteshvara, the very great Bodhisatva, known in China as 
Kuan-yin, literally “deserving (musical) modes.” One wonders 
whether this “World-observer” does not go back much farther: 
to Gilgamesh. We have to keep in mind that the Babylonians called 
their texts after their opening words; e.g., the Creation Epic they 
called Emima elish, i.e., “When above”; accordingly, what we call 
the Epic of Gilgamesh was with them Sha naqba irnuru, “Who saw 
everything.” Such are the bewildering changes rung by time on 
great and familiar themes. And there is more. Actually, when still 
young, this Vogulian “World-observing Man”—Avalokiteshvara 
himself, this great and worshiped deity of Buddhist countries— 
was, like Kullervo, a much-plagued orphan, first in the house of 
his uncle, then in the house of “the Russian” and in that “of the 
Samoyed.” After years of misery—quite specific “measured” mis¬ 
ery 35 —he kills all his tormentors. The revenge he takes is for 


31 This information comes from Johan Radulf (1723), quoted by K. Krohn, 
“Priapkultus,” FUF 6 (1906), p. 168, who identifies Waralden olmay with Freyr.

that the Ostyaks who have no writing are not likely to have hit upon such notions 
by themselves. (Holmberg, Der Baum des Lebens , p. 97). Cf. the entire chapter, 
“The Seven Gods of Fate” (pp. 113-33 °f same work) and Holmberg’s Finno-

35 E.g., in the house of “the Russian,” he is kept in the door hinge (in the English 
translation this and other details are blurred to insignificance), and dishwater is 
emptied upon him. To be damned to play door hinge is one of the hellish punish¬ 
ments in Egypt, because the hinge is supposed to turn in the victim’s eye. As con¬

himself. His father, who had lowered down the beloved son from 
the sky in a cradle, remained aloft. 

These hints will suffice for the time being. It does not matter 
whether or not pieces, or even the whole, of cosmological tradition 
came late to the Ural-Altaic populations, that is, whether Mani- 
cheism had a part in their propagation. The Manicheans took over 
the whole parcel of old traditions, changing only the signs, as hap¬ 
pens with every Gnostic system. Gnostics never have been of the 
inventive sort. Their very title, derived from their key word, gives 
the scheme away, gnosis tes hodou — knowledge of the way. The 
“Way” which had to be learned by heart is that which leads out- 
wards-upwards through the planetary spheres, past the threatening 
“watchtowers” of the zodiac to the desired timeless Light be¬ 
yond the sphere of fixed stars, above the Pole star: beyond and 
above everything, where the unknown god (agnostos theos) resides 
eternally. 36 

This “Way 1 ’ is not exactly the same for everybody, and the larg¬ 
est highroads are not everlasting, but the principle remains un- 

or toilet: we find this in the Eddie Lokasenna (34), where Loke says of Xjordr 
that he was used as chamber pot by Hymir's daughters; with the Polynesian case 
of Tawhaki, whose father Hema is abused in the very same manner, we deal in the 
chapter on Samson (see p. 1-5); this model of a “Horus-avenger-of-his-father” 
fulfills not only his filial duty, he does it by means of Amlethus' own “Xet-trick.” 
The Samoyed binds the pitiable ‘‘World-observing Man’’ to his sledge with an 
iron wire of thirty fathoms length. We do not know yet what this means precisely. 
We know that victorious characters use the vanquished as this or that vehicle, 
saddle horse, etc.—Marduk uses Tiamat as “ship,” as does Osiris with Seth: X’inur- 
ta’s “Elamitic chariot, carrying the corpse of Enmesharra” is drawn by “horses 
who are the death-demon of Zu” (Ebeling, Tod und Leben . p. 33); Tachma Rupa 
rides on Ahriman for thirty years around the two ends of the earth (\asht 7^.29; 
Yasht /_9, the Zamyad Yasht, is the one dedicated to Hvarna)—but these code 
formulae have not yet been broken. 

36 Absurd as it sounds, the many Gnostic sects who hated nothing more than 
philosophers and mathematicians have never denied or doubted the validity of 
their “evil” teachings. Sick with disgust, they learned the routes of ascension 
through (or across) those abominable spheres ruled by number, created by the 
evil powers. Surely, their “Father of Greatness” would not have created such a 
thing as a cosmos. Tradition does use the most peculiar vehicles for its motion 
through historical time. Or should one say, tradition did use? Face to face with 
the outbreaking revolution of “simple souls” against whichever rational thought, 
there is small reason for hope that our contemporary gnostics will hand down any 
tradition at all.

changed. The shaman travels through the skies in the very same 
manner as the Pharaoh did, well equipped as he was with his Pyra¬ 
mid Text or his Coffin Text, which represented his indispensable 
timetable and contained the ordained addresses of every celestial 
individual whom he was expected to meet. 37 The Pharaoh relied 
upon his particular text as the less distinguished dead relied upon 
his copy of chapters from the Book of the Dead, and he was pre¬ 
pared (as was the shaman) to change shape into the Sata serpent, 
a centipede, or the semblance of whatever celestial “station” must 
be passed, and to recite the fitting formulae to overcome hostile 
beings. 38 

To sum it up—whether Shamanism is an old or a relatively young 
offshoot of ancient civilization is irrelevant. It is not primitive at all, 
but it belongs, as all our civilizations do, to the vast company of 
ungrateful heirs of some almost unbelievable Near Eastern ancestor 
who first dared to understand the world as created according to 
number, measure and weight. 

If the Finnish runes and Altaic legends sound harmless enough, 
so do the popular traditions of most of the European countries, in¬ 
cluding Greece: the kind of mythology known through Bulfinch. 
But here at least there are additional less popular traditions which 
have preserved more of the severe spirit and style of old. So the 
(13th) Orphic Hymn to Kronos addresses the god as “Father of 

37 The ephemerides on the inner side of the coffin lids of the Middle Kingdom, 
and the astronomical ceilings in tombs of the New Kingdom, as well as the 
“Ramesside Star Clocks,” made navigation still easier for the royal soul. 

38 Many of the heavenly creatures do all the damage they possibly can; they try, 
for instance, to rob the dead of his text without which he would be helpless, and 
generally their conduct, as described in the literature of the Hereafter, is weird. 
Thus, in chapter 32 of the Book of the Dead, the crocodile of the West is accused 
of eating certain stars; the properly equipped soul, however, knows how to play up 
to the celestial monsters, and the traveler addresses the Northern crocodile with 
the words: “Get thee back, for the goddess Serqet is in my interior and I have not 
yet brought her forth.” The goddess Serqet is the constellation Scorpius. As con¬ 
cerns the Sata serpent, “whose years are infinite . . . who dwells at the farthest 
ends of the earth . . . who renews his youth everyday” (Book of the Dead, ch. 87), 
he makes himself suspect of representing the sphere of Saturn, whereas the centi¬ 
pede is not likely to fit any “body” besides Moon or Mercury; that it is no con¬ 
stellation is certain. 








133 * Shamans and Smiths 

the blessed gods as well as of man, you of changeful counsel, . . . 
strong Titan who devours all and begets it anew [lit. “you who 
consume all and increase it contrariwise yourself”], you who hold 
the indestructible bond according to the apeirona (unlimited) order 
of Aion, Kronos father of all, wily-minded Kronos, offspring of 
Gaia and starry Ouranos . . . venerable Prometheus.” Such sayings 
suddenly thrust information out of the usual patterns and show the 
true professional minds of ancient mythology working out their 
theorems. The only conventional attribute is “Son of Ouranos and 
Gaia.” Kronos is termed a Titan, because the word “God” belongs 
properly to the Olympian generation, whereas Saturn’s empire is 
not of “this world,” any more than that of the Indian Asura and 
the king of the golden Krita Yuga, Varuna; and the formula is 
found still in the medieval “Kaiser-Sage.” At the end of Thidrek’s 
(Theodoric’s) reign when there are only corpses left, a dwarf ap¬ 
pears and asks the king to follow him; “your empire is no more in 
this world.” 39 More puzzling, Kronos “is” that other Titan, Prome¬ 
theus, that other adversary of the “gods,” the Lighter of Fire. He 
“is” many more characters, too, but it will take some time to clear 
this up. We are at the heart of an “implex.” 

“Who holdest the unbreakable bond . . .” Assyrian Ninurta, too, 
holds “the bond of heaven and earth.” We shall also hear of a magi¬ 
cal invocation (see p. 147) that addresses Kronos as “founder of the 
world we live in.” These words are, however, insufficient and 
ambiguous. Not only are translations imprecise generally, but in 
our times of accelerated decay of language even the best-intentioned 
reader is likely to overlook such words as “bond” or “to found.” 
If instead he were to read “inch scale” and “to survey”—a divine 
foundation is every time a “temenos”—he would promptly react 
in a different manner. Kronos-Saturn has been and remains the one 
who owns the “inch scale,” who gives the measures, continuously, 
because he is “the originator of times,” as Macrobius says, although

of Etna.

the poor man mistakes him for the sun for this very reason. 40 But 
“Helios the Titan” is not Apollo, quite explicitly. 

Apart from this, apart also from Plutarch’s report, according to 
which Kronos, sleeping in that golden cave in Ogygia, dreams what 
Zeus is planning, 41 there is an Orphic fragment of greater weight, 
preserved in Proclus’ commentary on Plato’s Cratylus . 42 The Orphic 
text being one of the delicate sort, we quote some sentences only: 

The greatest Kronos is giving from above the principles of intelligi¬ 
bility to the Demiurge [Zeus], and he presides over the whole “crea¬ 
tion” [ demiourgia ]. That is why Zeus calls him “Demon” according 
to Orpheus, saying: “Set in motion our genus, excellent Demon!” 
And Kronos seems to have with him the highest causes of junctions 
and separations ... he has become the cause of the continuation of 
begetting and propagation and the head of the whole genus of Titans 
from which originates the division of beings [diairesis ton onton\. 

The passage ends thus: “Also Nyx prophesies to him [i.e., occa¬ 
sionally] but the father does so continuously [prosechos], and 
he gives him all the measures of the whole creation.” 43 

In Proclus’ style, the same phenomena which look simply flat and 
childish, mere “etymologizing,” when handled by others, sound 
extremely difficult—which they actually are. So let us shortly com¬ 
pare how Macrobius deals with the responsibility of Kronos for the 
“division of beings” (Sat. / .8.6—7) • After having mentioned the cur¬ 
rent identification of Kronos (Saturn) and Chronos (Time), so 
often contested by philologists, Macrobius states: 

They say, that Saturn cut off the private parts of his father Caelus 
[Ouranos], threw them into the sea, and out of them Venus was born 
who, after the foam [aphros] from which she was formed, accepted 
the name of Aphrodite. From this they conclude that, when there 
was chaos, no time existed, insofar as time is a fixed measure derived 
from the revolution of the sky. Time begins there; and of this is be-

ton Kronon.” 

42 Fr. 155, Kern, p. 194. 

43 Kai panta ta metra tes holes demiourgias endidosin. We might even say: 
Kronos “grants” him all the measures. 










How Kronos continually gives to Zeus “all the measures of the whole creation”: 
Kepler’s presentation of the Trigon built up by the Great Conjunctions of Saturn 
and Jupiter every twenty years. The motion of this Trigon along the zodiacal 
signs subdivided the cycle of the Precession, acting as a kind of vernier for this 
great cycle. To go around the whole zodiac, it takes one angle of the Trigon 
roughly 2400 years; to move from one sign of an elementary triplicity to the next 
sign of the same element takes about 800 years.

lieved to have been born Kronos who is Chronos, as was said before 
[see appendix it 12]. 44 

The fact is that the “separation of the parents of the world,” 
accomplished by means of the emasculation of Ouranos, stands for 
the establishing of the obliquity of the ecliptic: the beginning of 
measurable time. (The very same “event” was understood by .Mil- 
ton as the expulsion from Paradise [appendix #13].) And Saturn 
has been “appointed” to be the one who established it because he is 
the outermost planet, nearest to the sphere of fixed stars. 40 “This 
planet was taken for the one who communicated motion to the 
Universe and who was, so to speak, its king”; this is what Schlegel 
reports of China ( VUranographie Cbinoise, pp. 6z 8flF.). 

Saturn does give the measures: this is the essential point. How are 
we to reconcile it with Saturn the First King, the ruler of the 
Golden Age who is now asleep at the outer confines of the world- 
The conflict is only apparent, as will be seen. For now it is essential 
to recognize that, whether one has to do with the .Mesopotamian 
Saturn, Enki/Ea, or with Ptah of Egypt, he is the “Lord of 
Measures”—spell it me in Sumerian, parshu in Akkadian, maat in 
Egyptian. And the same goes for His Majesty, the Yellow Emperor 
of China—yellow, because the element earth belongs to Saturn— 
“Huang-ti established everywhere the order for the sun, the moon 
and the stars.” 46 The melody remains the same. It might help to 

44 Ex quo intcllegi volunt, cum chaos esset, tempora non fuisse, siquidem tempus 
est certa dimensio quae ex caeli conversione colligirur. Tempus coepit inde, ab 
ipso natus putatur Kronos qui, ut diximus, Chronos est. 

45 It is not hidden from us that the indestructible laws of philology do not allow 
for the identification of Kronos and Chronos, although in Greece to do so “was 
customary at all times” (M. Pohlenz, in RE //, col. 1986). We have, indeed, no acute 
reason to insist upon this generalizing identification—the “name” of a planet is a 
function of time and con-stellation—yet it seems advisable to emphasize, on the 
one hand, that technical terminology has its own laws and is not subject to the 
jurisdiction of linguists, and to point, on the other hand, to one of the Sanskrit 
names of Saturn, i.e., “Kala,” meaning “time” and “death,” and “blue-black” (A.

color which suits the planet perfectly, all over the world—and to point, moreover, 
to a passage from the Persian Minokheird (West trans. in R. Eisler, Weltemnantel 
und Hivimelszelt [1910], p. 410): “The creator, Auharmazd (Jupiter) produced 
his creation . . . with the blessing of Unlimited Time (Zurvan akarana).”

understand the general idea, but particularly the lucubration of 
Proclus, to have a look at the figure drawn by Kepler, which 
represents the moving triangle fabricated by “Great Conjunctions,” 
that is, those of Saturn and Jupiter. One of these points needs 
roughly 2,400 years to move through the whole zodiac. The next 
chapter will show why this is of high importance: here it suffices to 
point to one possible manner in which measures are given “con¬ 
tinuously.” 

Saturn, giver of the measures of the cosmos, remains the “Star 
of Law and Justice” in Babylon, 47 also the “Star of Nemesis” in 
Egypt, 48 the Ruler of Necessity and Retribution, in brief, the Em¬ 
peror. 49 In China, Saturn has the title “Genie du pivot,” as the god 
who presides over the Center, the same title which is given to the 
Pole star. 50 This is puzzling at first, and so is the laconic state¬ 
ment coming from Mexico: “In the year 2-Rced Tczcatlipoca 
changed into Mixcouatl, because Mixcouatl has his seat at the North 
pole and, being now Mixcouatl, he drilled fire with the fire sticks 
for the first time.” It is not in the line of modern astronomy to 
establish any link connecting the planets with Polaris, or with any 
star, indeed, out of reach of the members of the zodiacal system. 
Yet such figures of speech were an essential part of the technical 
idiom of archaic astrology, and those experts in ancient cultures 
who could not understand such idioms have remained completely 
helpless in the face of the theory. What has Saturn, the far-out 
planet, to do with the pole? Yet, if he cannot be recognized as the 
“genie of the pivot,” how is it possible to support Amlodhi’s claim 
to be the legitimate owner of the Mill?
