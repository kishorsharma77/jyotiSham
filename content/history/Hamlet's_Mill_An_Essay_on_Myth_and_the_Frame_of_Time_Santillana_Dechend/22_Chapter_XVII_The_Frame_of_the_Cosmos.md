La mythologie, dans son origine, 
est l’ouvrage de la science; la 
science seule l’expliquera. 

Charles Dupuis 


Jn Greek myth, the basic frame of the world is described in the 
famous Vision of Er in the ioth Book of the Republic. In it we find 
Er the Armenian, who was resurrected from the funeral pyre just 
before it was kindled, and who describes his travel through the 
other world (/ 0.6 15ff.). He and the group of souls bound for re¬ 
birth whom he accompanies travel through the other world. They 
come to “a straight shaft of light, like a pillar, stretching from above 
throughout heaven and earth—and there, at the middle of the light, 
they saw stretching from heaven the extremities of its chains; for 
this light binds the heavens, holding together all the revolving 
firmament like the undergirths of a ship of war. And from the 
extremities stretched the Spindle of Necessity, by means of which 
all the circles revolve.” 

Cornford adds in a note: “It is disputed whether the bond hold¬ 
ing the Universe together is simply the straight axial shaft or a 
circular band of light, suggested by the Milky Way, 1 girdling the 
heaven of fixed stars.” 2 Eisler understood it as the zodiac, strange 
to say. 3 Since those “undergirths” of the trireme did not go around 
the ship horizontally, but were meant to secure the mast (the

“tree” of the ship) which points upwards, we stand, on princi¬ 
ple, for the Galaxy, which, however, had to be “replaced” by in¬ 
visible colures in later times. 4 But Er also talks of the adventures of 
the souls between incarnations, and in this context we might rely 
on the Milky Way. Surely the “model” is far from clear, even, on 
Cornford’s concession, obviously intentionally so. And indeed, a 
few paragraphs later, there comes the complete planetarium with 
its “whorls,” the “Spindle of Necessity” held by the goddess, by 
which sit the Fates as they unwind the threads of men’s lives. The 
souls can listen to the Song of Lachesis, if they are still in the 
“meadow,” but the chains and shaft or band are no longer in 
the picture. Plato refuses to be a correct geometrician of the Other 
World, just as he would not be sensible about the hydraulics of 
it. But previously in the Phaedo, Socrates had been ironic about 
the “truths” of science, and insisted that the truths of myth are of 
another order, and rebellious to ordinary consistency. It is here as if 
Plato had juxtaposed a number of revered mythical traditions (in¬ 
cluding the planetary harmony) without pretending to fit them into 
a proper order. And so his image of the “framework” of the cosmos 
is left inconclusive. But somehow the axis and the band and the 
chains stand together, and this, one concludes, was the original idea. 
The rotation of the polar axis must not be disjointed from the 
great circles which shift along with it in heaven. The framework 
is thought of as all one with the axis. This leads back to a Pythago¬ 
rean authority whom Plato was supposed to have followed (Timon 
even viciously said: plagiarized) and whom Socrates often quotes 
with unfeigned respect. It is Philolaos, surely a creative astronomer 
of high rank, from whom there are only a few surviving fragments, 
and the authenticity of these has been rashly challenged by many 
modern philologists. 5 In fragment 12 of Philolaos, there is a brief 
definition of the cosmos, very much in the spirit of Plato’s dode- 


4 Cf. also the discussion in J. L. E. Dreyer, A History of Astronomy from 
Thales to Kepler (1953), pp. 56#. Concerning the “chains,” which he translates 
“ligatures,” Dreyer states: “The ligatures ( desmoi ) of the heavens are the solstitial 
and equinoctial colures intersecting in the poles, which points therefore may be 
called their extremities ( akra ).”

cahedron quoted in chapter XII. “In the sphere there are five ele¬ 
ments, those inside the sphere, fire, and water and earth and air, 
and what is the hull of the sphere, the fifth.” 6 Notwithstanding 
Philolaos’ graceless Doric, the statement is perfectly clear. The 
“hull,” (olkas) was the common name for freighters, built for bulk 
cargo, broad in the beam. It is really more adequate than Plato’s 
slim trireme; and it is closer in shape to what both men meant 
apparently: the dodecahedron, the “hull,” i.e., the sphere, the 
actual containing frame. It is clear from Plato that the “fifth” is the 
sphere that he calls ether which contains the four earthly elements 
but is wholly removed from them. Aristotle was to change it to the 
crystalline heavenly “matter” that he needed for his system, but 
it remained for him a “fifth essence.” There has thus been twice 
repeated the original “hull,” the frame that has been sought. What 
happened, and was noted in chapter VII, was that the etymology 
of Sampo was discovered to be in the Sanskrit skambha. 

The abstract idea of a simple earth axis, so natural today, was 
by no means so logical to the ancients, who always thought of the 
whole machinery of heaven moving around the earth, stable at the 
center. One line always implied many others in a structure. So, 
apparently one must accept the idea of the world frame as an implex 
(as used here and later this word involves the necessary attributes 
that are associated with a concept: e.g., the center and circumfer¬ 
ence of a circle, the parallels and meridians implied by a sphere), 
of which Grotte and Sampo were the rude models with their pon¬ 
derous moving parts. 

Like the axle of the mill, the tree, the skambha, also represents 
the world axis. This instinctively suggests a straight, upright post, 
but the word axis is a simplification of the real concept. There is the 
invisible axis, of course, which is crowned by the North Nail, but 
this image needs to be enriched by two more dimensions. The term 
world axis is an abbreviation of language comparable to the visual 
abbreviation achieved by projecting the reaches of the sky onto a 
flat star map. It is best not to think of the axis in straight analytical 
terms, one line at a time, but to consider it, and the frame to which 
6 See H. Diels, Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker (1951), vol. 1, pp. 412L 





233 ' The Frame of the Cosmos 

it is connected, as one whole. This involves the use of multivalent 
terms and the recognition of a convergent involution of unusual 
meanings. 

As radius automatically calls circle to mind, so axis must invoke 
the two determining great circles on the surface of the sphere, the 
equinoctial and solstitial colures. Pictured this way, the axis resem¬ 
bles a complete armillary sphere. It stands for the system of coor¬ 
dinates of the sphere and represents the frame of a world-age. 
Actually the frame defines a world-age. Because the polar axis and 
the colures form an indivisible whole, the entire frame is thrown 
out of kilter if one part is moved. When that happens, a new Pole 
star with appropriate colures of its own must replace the obsolete 
apparatus. 

Thus the Sanskrit skambha, the world pillar, ancestor of the 
Finnish Sampo, is shown to be an integral element in the scheme 
of things. The hymn 10 .7 of the Atharva Veda is dedicated to the 
skambha, and Whitney, its translator and commentator 7 sounds 
puzzled in his footnote to /0.7.2: “Skambha, lit. ‘prop, support, 
pillar,’ strangely used in this hymn as frame of the universe or held 
personified as its soul.” Here are two verses of it: 

12. In whom earth, atmosphere, in whom sky is set, where fire, moon, 
sun, wind stand fixed, that Skambha tell . . . 

35. The Skambha sustains both heaven-and-earth here; the skambha 
sustains the wide atmosphere, the skambha sustains the six wide 
directions; into the skambha entered this whole existence. 

The good old Sampo sounds less pretentious, but it does have its 
three “roots,” “one in heaven, one in the earth, one in the water- 
eddy.” 8 To make a drawing of a pillarlike tree (let alone a mill), 
with its roots distributed in the manner indicated, would be quite a 
task. Notably it takes the “enormous bull of Pohja”—obviously a 
cosmic bull—to plow up these strange roots: the Finnish heroes by 
themselves had not been able to uproot the Sampo. 

In the case of Yggdrasil, the World Ash, Rydberg tried his hard¬ 
est to localize the three roots, to imagine and to draw them. Since he

Hamlet’s Mill • 234 


looked with steadfast determination into the interior of our globe, 
the result was not overly convincing. One of the roots is said to 
belong to the Asa in heaven, and beneath it is the most sacred foun¬ 
tain of Urd. The second is to be found in the quarters of the frost- 
giants “where Ginnungagap formerly was,” and where the well of 
Alimir now is. The third root belongs to Niflheim, the realm of the 
dead, and under this root is Hvergelmer, the Whirlpool (Gy If . 15). 9 

This precludes any terrestrial diagram. It looks as though the 
“axis,” implicating the equinoctial and solstitial colures, runs 
through the “three worlds” which are, to state it roughly and most 
inaccurately, the following: 

(a) the sky north of the Tropic of Cancer, i.e., the sky proper, do¬ 
main of the gods 

(b) the “inhabited world” of the zodiac between the Tropics, the 
domain of the “living” 

(c) the sky south from the Tropic of Capricorn, alias the Sweet- 
Water Ocean, the realm of the dead. 

The demarcation plane between solid earth and sea is represented 
by the celestial equator; hence half of the zodiac is under “water,” 
the southern ecliptic, bordered by the equinoctial points. There 
are more refined subdivisions, to be sure, “zones” or “belts” or 
“climates,” dividing the sphere from north to south and, most im¬ 
portant, the “sky” as well as the waters of the south have a share 
in the “inhabited world” allotted to them. 10 This summary is an 
almost frivolous simplification, but for the time being it may be 
sufficient. 

9 We are aware that either Grotte “should” have three roots, or that Yggdrasil 
should be uprooted, and that the Finns do not tell how the maelstrom came into 
being. All of which can be explained; we wish, however, to avoid dragging more 
and more material into the case. Several ages of the world have passed away, and 
they do not perish all in the same manner; e.g., the Finns know of the destruction 
of Sampo and of the felling of the huge Oak. 

10 To clear up the exact range of the three worlds, it would be necessary to 
work out the whole history of the Babylonian “Ways of Anu, Enlil, and Ea” (cf. 
pp. 43if.), and how these “Ways” were adapted, changed, and defined anew 
by the many heirs of ancient oriental astronomy. And then we would not 
yet be wise to the precise whereabouts of Air, Saltwater, and other ambiguous 
items. 









235 * The Frame of the Cosmos 

Meanwhile, it is necessary to explain again what this “earth” is 
that modern interpreters like to take for a pancake. The mythical 
earth is, in fact, a plane, but this plane is not our “earth” at all, 
neither our globe, nor a presupposed homocentrical earth. “Earth” 
is the implied plane through the four points of the year, marked by 
the equinoxes and solstices, in other words the ecliptic. And this is 
why this earth is very frequently said to be quadrangular. The four 
“corners,” that is, the zodiacal constellations rising heliacally at both 
the equinoxes and solstices, parts of the “frame” skambha, are the 
points which determine an “earth.” Every world-age has its own 
“earth.” It is for this very reason that “ends of the world” are said 
to take place. A new “earth” arises, when another set of zodiacal 
constellations brought in by the Precession determines the year 
points. 

Once the reader has made the adjustment needed to think of the 
frame instead of the “pillar” he will understand easily many queer 
scenes which would be strictly against nature—ideas about planets 
performing feats at places which are out of their range, as both the 
poles are. He will understand why a force planning to uproot (or 
to chop down) a tree, or to unhinge a mill, or merely pull out a 
plug, or a pin, does not have to go “up”—or “down”—all the way 
to the pole to do it. The force causes the same effect when it pulls 
out the nearest available part of the “frame” within the inhabited 
world. 

Here are some examples of the manipulation of the frame, begin¬ 
ning with a most insignificant survival. Actually this is a useful 
approach, because the less meaningful the example, the more aston¬ 
ishing is the fact of its surviving. Turkmen tribes of southern 
Turkestan tell about a copper pillar marking the “navel of the 
earth,” and they state that “only the nine-year-old hero Kara Par 
is able to lift and to extract” it. 11 As goes without saying, nobody 
comments on the strange idea that someone should be eager to 
“extract the navel of the earth.” When Young Arthur does it with 
Excalibur, the events have already been fitted into a more familiar 
frame and they provoke no questions.

In its grandiose style, the Mahabharata presents a similar prodigy 
as follows: 

It w as Vishvamitra who in anger created a second world and numer¬ 
ous stars beginning with Sravana . . . He can burn the three worlds 
by his splendour, can, by stamping (his foot), cause the Earth to 
quake. He can sever the great Meru from the Earth and hurl it to any 
distance. He can go round the 10 points of the Earth in a moment . 12 

Vishvamitra is one of the seven stars of the Big Dipper, this at 
least has been found out. But each planet is represented by a star of 
the Wain, and vice versa, so this case does not look particularly 
helpful. 13 

A cosmic event of the first order can be easily overlooked when 
it hides modestly in a fairy tale. The following, taken from the 
Indian “Ocean of Stories,” tells of Shiva: “When he drove his tri¬ 
dent into the heart of Andhaka, the king of the Asuras, though he 
was only one, the dart which that monarch had infixed into the 
heart of the three worlds was, strange to say, extracted.” 14 

A plot can also shrink to unrecognizable insignificance when it 

12 AIbh. 7.71, Roy trans., vol. /, p. 171. 

13 The notion of “numerous [newly appointed] stars beginning with Sravana” 
should enlighten us. Sravana, “the Lame,” is, in the generally accepted order, the 
twenty-first lunar mansion, alpha beta gamma Aquilae, also called by the name 
Ashvatta , which stands for a sacred fig tree but which means literally “below which 
the horses stand” (Scherer, Gestirnnamen , p. 158), and which invites a comparison 
with Old Norse Yggdrasil, meaning “the tree below which Odin’s horse grazes” 
(Reuter, Germanische Himmelskunde , p. 236). Actually, the solstitial colure ran 
through alpha beta gamma Aquilae around 300 b.c., and long after the time when 
it used to pass through one or the other of the stars of the Big Dipper; the 
equinoctial colure, however, comes down very near eta Ursae Alajoris. Consider¬ 
ing that eta maintains the most cordial relations with Alars in occidental astrology, 
Vishvamitra might be eta, and might represent Alars, and that would go well 
with the violent character of this Rishi. But even if we accept this for a working 
hypothesis, there remains the riddle of the “second world,” i.e., “second” with 
respect to which “first” world? Although we have a hunch, we are not going to 
try to solve it here and now. Two pieces of information should be mentioned, 
however: (1) AIbh. 74.44 (Roy trans., vol. 12 , p. 83) states: “The constellations 
[= lunar mansions, nakshatras ] have Sravana for their first”; (2) Sengupta (in 
Burgess’ trans. of Surya Siddhanta , p. xxxiv) claims that “the time of the present 
redaction of the Mahabharata ” was called “Sravanadi kala, i.e., the time when the 
winter solstitial colure passed through the nakshatra Sravana.”

comes disguised as history, but this next story at least has been 
pinned down to the proper historical character, and even has been 
checked by a serious military historian like Arrianus, who tells us 
the following: 

Alexander, then, reached Gordium, and was seized with an ardent 
desire to ascend to the acropolis, where was the palace of Gordius and 
his son Midas, and to look at Gordius’ wagon and the knot of the 
chariot’s yoke. There was a widespread tradition about this chariot 
around the countryside; Gordius, they said, was a poor man of the 
Phrygians of old, who tilled a scanty parcel of earth and had but two 
yoke of oxen: with one he ploughed, with the other he drove his 
wagon. Once, as he was ploughing, an eagle settled on the yoke and 
stayed, perched there, till it was time to loose the oxen; Gordius was 
astonished at the portent, and went off to consult the Telmissian 
prophets, who were skilled in the interpretation of prodigies, inherit¬ 
ing—women and children too—the prophetic gift. Approaching a 
Telmissian village, he met a girl drawing water and told her the story 
of the eagle: she, being also of the prophetic line, bade him return to 
the spot and sacrifice to Zeus the King. So then Gordius begged her 
to come along with him and assist in the sacrifice; and at the spot duly 
sacrificed as she directed, married the girl, and had a son called Midas. 

Midas was already a grown man, handsome and noble, when the 
Phrygians were in trouble with civil war; they received an oracle 
that a chariot would bring them a king and he would stop the war. 
True enough, while they were discussing this, there arrived Midas, 
with his parents, and drove, chariot and all, into the assembly. The 
Phrygians, interpreting the oracle, decided that he was the man 
whom the gods had told them would come in a chariot; they there¬ 
upon made him king, and he put an end to the civil war. The chariot 
of his father he set up in the acropolis as a thank-offering to Zeus the 
king for sending the eagle. 

Over and above this there was a story about the wagon, that anyone 
who should untie the knot of the yoke should be lord of Asia. This 
knot was of cornel bark, and you could see neither beginning nor 
end of it. Alexander, unable to find how to untie the knot, and not 
brooking to leave it tied, lest this might cause some disturbance in 
the vulgar, smote it with his sword, cut the knot, and exclaimed, “I 
have loosed it!”—so at least say some, but Aristobulus puts it that 
he took out the pole pin , a dowel driven right through the pole, hold¬ 
ing the knot together, and so removed the yoke from the pole. I do 
not attempt to be precise how Alexander actually dealt with this 
knot. Anyway, he and his suite left the wagon with the impression 




Hamlet’s Mill • 238 

that the oracle about the loosed knot had been duly fulfilled. It is 
certain that there were that night thundcrings and lightnings, which 
indicated this; so Alexander in thanksgiving offered sacrifice next day 
to whatever gods had sent the signs and certified the undoing of the 
knot . 15 

Without going now into the relevant comparative material it 
should be stressed that in those cases where “kings” are sitting in a 
wagon (Greek hai/iaxa), i.e., a four-wheeled truck, it is most of the 
time Charles' Wain. 

Alexander was a true myth builder, or rather, a true myth- 
attracting magnet. He had a gift for attracting to his fabulous per¬ 
sonality the manifold tradition that, once, had been coined for 
Gilgamesh. 

But the time is not yet ripe either for Alexander or for Gilga¬ 
mesh, nor for further statements about deities or heroes who could 
pull out pins, plugs and pillars. The next concern is with the deci¬ 
sive features of the mythical landscape and their possible localiza¬ 
tion, or their fixation in time. It is essential to know where and 
when the first whirlpool came into being once Grotte, Amlodhi’s 
Mill, had been destroyed. This is, however, a misleading expression 
because our terminology is still much too imprecise. It would be 
better to say the first exit from, or entrance to, the whirlpool. It 
appears advisable to recapitulate the bits of information that have 
been gathered on the whirlpool as a whole: 

The maelstrom, result of a broken mill, a chopped-down tree, 
and the like, “goes through the whole globe,” according to the 
Finns. So does Tartaros, according to Socrates. To repeat it in 
Guthrie’s words: “The earth in this myth of Socrates is spherical, 
and Tartaros, the bottomless pit, is represented in this mythical 
geography by a chasm which pierces the sphere right through from 
side to side.” 16 

It is source and mouth of all waters. 

It is the way, or one among others, to the realm of the dead. 
Medieval geographers call it “Umbilicus Maris,” Navel of the 
Sea, or “Euripus.”

239 ’ The Frame of the Cosmos 

Antiochus the astrologer calls Eridanus proper, or some abstract 
topos not far from Sirius, “zalos,” i.e., whirlpool. 

M. W. Makemson looks for the Polynesian whirlpool, said to be 
“at the end of the sky,” “at the edge of the Galaxy,” in Sagittarius. 

A Dyak hero, climbing a tree in “Whirlpool-Island,” lands him¬ 
self in the Pleiades. 

But generally, one looks for “it” in the more or less northwest- 
north-northwest direction, a direction where, equally vaguely, 
Kronos-Saturn is supposed to sleep in his golden cave notwithstand¬ 
ing the blunt statements (by Homer) that Kronos was hurled down 
into deepest Tartaros. 

And from those “infernal” quarters, particularly from the (Ogy- 
gian) Stygian landscape, “one”—who else but the souls?—sees the 
celestial South Pole, invisible to us. 

The reader might agree that this summary shows clearly the 
insufficiency of the general terminology accepted by the majority. 
The verbal confusion provokes sympathy for Numenius (see above, 
p. 188), and the Third Vatican Mythographer who took the rivers 
for planets, their planetary orbs respectively. We think that the 
whirlpool stands for the “ecliptical world” marked by the whirling 
planets, embracing everything which circles obliquely with respect 
to the polar axis and the equator—oblique by 23V2 degrees, more 
or less, each planet having its own obliquity with respect to the 
others and to the sun’s path, that is, the ecliptic proper. It has been 
mentioned earlier (p. 206, n. 5) that in the axis of the Roman circus 
was a Euripus , and altars of the three outer planets (Saturn, Jupiter, 
Mars), and the three inner planets (Venus, Mercury, Moon) on 
both sides of the pyramid of the sun, and that there were not more 
than seven circuits because the “planets are seven only.” 

The ecliptic as a whirl is only one aspect of the famous “implex.” 
It must be kept in mind that being the seat of all planetary powers, 
it represented, so to speak, the “Establishment” itself. There is no 
better symbol of the thinking of those planet-struck Mesopotamian 
civilizations than the arrogant plan of the royal cities themselves, 
as it has been patiently reconstructed by generations of Orientalists 
and archaeologists. Nineveh proclaimed itself as the seat of stable

order and power by its seven-times crenellated circle of walls, col¬ 
ored with the seven planetary colors, and so thick that chariots 
could run along the top. The planetary symbolism spread to India, 
as was seen in chapter VIII, and culminated in that prodigious 
cosmological diagram that is the temple of Barabudur in Java. 17 It is 
still evident in the innumerable stupas which dot the Indian country¬ 
side, whose superimposed crowns stand for the planetary heavens. 
And here we have the Establishment seen as a Way Up and Be¬ 
yond, as Numenius would have seen immediately, the succession 
of spheres of transition for the soul, a quiet promise of transcen¬ 
dence which marks the Gnostic and Hinduistic scheme. The skele¬ 
ton map will always lack one or the other dimension. The Whirl is 
then a way up or a way down? Heraclitus would say both ways 
are one and the same. You cannot put into a scheme everything at 
once. 

This general conception of the whirlpool as the “ecliptical 
world” does not, of course, help to understand any single detail. 
Starting from the idea of the whirlpool as a way to the other world, 
one must look at the situation through the eyes of a soul meaning 
to go there. It has to move from the interior outwards, to “ascend” 
from the geocentric earth through the planetary spheres “up” to the 
fixed sphere, that is, right through the whole whirlpool, the eclip¬ 
tical world. But in order to leave the ecliptical frame, there must 
be a station for changing trains at the equator. One would expect 
this station to be at the crossroads of ecliptical and equatorial coor¬ 
dinates at the equinoxes. But evidently, this was not the arrange¬ 
ment. A far older route was followed. It is true that it sometimes 
looks as though the transfer point were at the equinoxes. The astro¬ 
logical tradition that followed Teukros, 18 for example, provided 
a rich offering of celestial locations for Hades, the Acherusian lake, 
Charon the ferryman, etc., all of them under the chapter Libra. 
But this is a trap and one can only hope that many hapless souls 
have not been deceived. For these astrological texts mean the sign

Libra, not the constellation. All “change stations” are found in¬ 
variably in two regions: one in the South between Scorpius and 
Sagittarius, the other in the North between Gemini and Taurus; 
and this is valid through time and space, from Babylon to Nica¬ 
ragua. 19 Why was it ever done in the first place? Because of the 
Galaxy, which has its crossroads with the ecliptic between Sagit¬ 
tarius and Scorpius in the South, and between Gemini and Taurus 
in the North. 

19 The notion is not even foreign to the cheering adventures of Swi, the Chinese 
Monkey (Wou Tch’eng Ngen , French trans. by Louis Avenol [1957]). One day, 
two “harponneurs des morts” get hold of him, claiming that he has arrived at the 
term of his destiny, and is ripe for the underworld. He escapes, of course. The 
translator remarks (vol. /, p. iii) that it is the constellation Nan Teou, the Southern 
Dipper, that decides everybody’s death, and the orders are executed by these 
“harponneurs des morts.” The Southern Dipper consists of the stars mu lambda 
phi sigma tau zeta Sagittarii (cf. G. Schlegel, VUranographie Chinoise [1875], pp. 
172#.; L. de Saussure, Les Origines de /’Astronomie Chinoise [1930], pp. 452L).
