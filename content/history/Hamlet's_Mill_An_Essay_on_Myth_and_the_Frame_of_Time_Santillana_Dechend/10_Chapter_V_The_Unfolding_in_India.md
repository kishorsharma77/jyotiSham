JL he parallel between the Tale of Kai Khusrau and the final 
plot of the vast Hindu epic, the Mahabharata , has received attention 
for over a century. It was noticed by the great Orientalist James 
Darmesteter. The translators of Firdausi are not unaware of it, and 
they analyze the last phase of events as follows: 

The legend of Kai Khusrau’s melancholy, his expedition into the 
mountains, and his attainment to heaven without having tasted death 
has its parallel in the Mahabharata , where Yudhishthira, the eldest of 
the five Pandavas, becoming weary of the world, resolves to retire 
from the sovereignty and acquire merit by pilgrimage. On hearing of 
his intentions his four brothers—Bhima, Arjuna, and the twins Na- 
kula and Sahadeva—resolve to follow his example and accompany 
him. Yudhishthira appoints successors to his various kingdoms. The 
citizens and the inhabitants of the provinces, hearing the king’s 
words, became filled with anxiety and disapproved of them. “This 
should never be done”—said they unto the king. The monarch, well 
versed with the changes brought about by time, did not listen to 
their counsels. Possessed of righteous soul, he persuaded the people 
to sanction his views . . . Then Dharma’s son, Yudhishthira, the King 
of Pandavas, casting off his ornaments, wore barks of trees . . . The 
five brothers, with Draupadi forming the sixth [she was the joint 
wife of the brothers], and a dog forming the seventh, set out on their 
journey. The citizens and the ladies of the royal household followed

them for some distance . . . The denizens of the city then returned 
[exactly as Kai Khusrau’s subjects had done]. The seven pilgrims 
meanwhile had set out upon their journey. They first wandered east¬ 
ward, then southward, and then westward. Lastly they faced north¬ 
ward and crossed the Himalaya. Then they beheld before them a 
vast desert of sand and beyond it Mount Meru. One by one the pil¬ 
grims sank exhausted and expired, first Draupadi, then the twins, then 
Arjuna, then Bhima; but Yudhishthira, who never even looked back 
at his fallen comrades, still pressed on and, followed by the faithful 
dog who turns out to be Dharma (the Law), in disguise, entered 
Heaven in his mortal body, not having tasted death. 

Among minor common traits, Warner stresses particularly these: 

Both journey into the mountains with a devoted band, the number 
of them is the same in both cases, and both are accompanied by a 
divine being, for the part of the dog in the Indian legend is indicated 
in the Iranian as being taken by Surush, the angel of Urmuzd. In 
both, the leaders pass deathless into Heaven, and in both their mor¬ 
tal comrades perish. One legend therefore must be derived from the 
other, or else, and this seems to be the better opinion, they must be 
referred to a common origin of great antiquity. 1 

Of great antiquity these legends must be, indeed; otherwise there 
would not be a very similar end ascribed to Enoch and to Quetzal- 
couatl. In fact, just as Kai Khusrau’s paladins did not listen to the 
Shah’s advice not to remain with him until k his ascension—the crowd 
had been left behind, anyhow—so Enoch 

urged his retinue to turn back: “Go ye home, lest death overtake you, 
if you follow me farther.” Most of them—800,000 there were— 
heeded his words and went back, but a number remained with him 
for six days. . . On the sixth day of the journey, he said to those still 
accompanying him, “Go ye home, for on the morrow I shall ascend 
to heaven, and whoever will then be near me, he will die.” Neverthe¬ 
less, some of his companions remained with him, saying: “Whither¬ 
soever thou goest, we will go. By the living God, death alone shall 
part us.” On the seventh day Enoch was carried into the heavens in 
a fiery chariot drawn by fiery chargers. The day thereafter, the kings 
who had turned back in good time sent messengers to inquire into the 
fate of the men who had refused to separate themselves from Enoch, 
for they had noted the number of them. They found snow and great 
hailstones upon the spot whence Enoch had risen, and, when they 
searched beneath, they discovered the bodies of all who had remained

behind with Enoch. He alone was not among them; he was on high 

in heaven. 2 

Quetzalcouad’s paladins, “the slaves, the dwarves, the hunch 
backed . . . they died there from the cold . . . , upon all of them fell 
the snow,” in the mountain pass between Popocatepetl and Iztacte- 
petl. 3 4 5 Quetzalcouatl, lamenting, and utterly lonely, had some more 
stations to pass, before he took off on his serpent raft, announcing 
he would come back, someday, “to judge the living and the dead” 
(appendix #3). 

Were it only the dry fact of Yudhishthira’s ascension, and the 
end of his companions high up in the mountains, we might have 
avoided the maze of the Mahabharata altogether. But, labyrinthine 
as this epic of twelve volumes truly is—and the same goes for the 
Puranas —Indian myth offers keys to secret chambers to be had 
nowhere else. The Mahabharata tells of the war of the Pandavas 
and the Kauravas, that is the Pandu brothers and the Kuru brothers, 
who correspond to the Iranians and Turanians, to the sons of Ka- 
leva and the people of Untamo, etc. Thus far the general situation 
is not foreign to us. But the epic states unmistakably that this tre¬ 
mendous war was fought during the interval between the Dvapara 
and the Kali Yugad 

This “dawn” between two world-ages can be specified further. 
The real soul and force on the side of the Pandavas is Krishna—in 
the words of Arjuna: “He, who was our strength, our might, our 
heroism, our prowess, our prosperity, our brightness, has left us, and 
departed.” 3 Now Krishna (“the Black”) is the most outstanding 
avatar of Vishnu. And it is only when Krishna has been shot in the 
heel (or the sole of his foot), the only vulnerable spot of his body, 
by the hunter Jara (= old age) that the Pandavas, too, resolve to 
depart—just as Kai Khusrau did after the death of Kai Ka'us. There 
was Kai Khusrau’s statement: “And now I deem it better to de-

part . . . Because this Kaian crown and throne will pass.” And this 
happens at the following crucial point: 

When that portion of Vishnu (that had been born by Vasudeva and 
Devakij returned to heaven, then the Kali age commenced. As long 
as the earth was touched by his sacred feet, the Kali age could not 
affect it. As soon as the incarnation of the eternal Vishnu had de¬ 
parted, the son of Dharma, Yudhishthira, with his brethren, abdicated 
the sovereignty . . . The day that Krishna shall have departed from 
the earth will be the first of the Kali age ... it will continue for 
360,000 years of mortals. 6 

And as Krishna is reunited with Vishnu, as Arjuna returns into 
Indra, 7 and Balarama into the Shesha-Serpent, so it will happen to 
the other heroes. Thus, when Yudhishthira is finally rejoined with 
his whole Pandu-Family in heaven, the poet Sauti explains, 

“That the various heroes, after exhausting their Karma, become re¬ 
united with that deity of which they were avatars.” 8 

Yudhishthira is reunited with Dharma, disguised as a faithful dog. 9 
Seen from this vantage point, the Finnish epic appears as a last dim 
and apparently meaningless reflection. Kullervo goes with the black 
dog Musti, the only living soul left from his home, into the forest 
where he throws himself upon his sword. 

Now what about Krishna, most beloved deity of the Hinduistic 
Pantheon? Some of his innumerable deeds and victorious adventures 
before his “departure” will look familiar.

day that Krishna departed from the earth the powerful dark-bodied Kali age

9 Arrived at the last stage of deterioration, we find Dharma, the Dog, in a fairy 
tale from Albania: The youngest daughter of a king—her two sisters resemble 
Regan and Goneril—offers to go to war in her father’s place, asking for three suits 
only, and for the paternal blessing. “Then the king procured three male suits, and 
gave her his blessing, and this blessing changed into a little dog and went with the 
princess.” (J. G. von Hahn: Griechische und Albanische Mdrchen [1918., vol. a, 
p. 146.).

Young Krishna is the persecuted nephew of a cruel uncle, Kansa 
(or Kamsa), both being, as Keith 10 styles it, “protagonists in a ritual 
contest.” This is not modestly understating it, but grossly mislead¬ 
ing. Kansa is an Asura (appendix #4), and Krishna is a Deva, and 
that means, again, that the affair concerns the great divine “Parties” 
(Iranians-Turanians, and the like). The uncle, warned beforehand 
through prophecies about the danger coming from the eighth son 
of Devaki and Vasudeva, kills six children of this couple, but the 
seventh (Balarama) and eighth (Krishna) are saved and live with 
herdsmen. There young Krishna performs some of the deeds of the 
“Strong Boy.” 

If Kullervo, three days old, destroyed his cradle, we might ex¬ 
pect something spectacular from Krishna, and we are not disap¬ 
pointed: 

On one occasion, whilst iVladhusudana was asleep underneath the 
wagon, he cried for the breast, and kicking up his feet he overturned 
the vehicle, and all the pots and pans were upset and broken. The 
cowherds and their wives, hearing the noise, came exclaiming: “Ah! 
ah!” and they found the child sleeping on his back. “Who could have 
upset the wagon?” said the cowherds. “This child,” replied some 
boys, who witnessed the circumstance; “w r e saw him,” said they, 
“crying, and kicking the wagon w 7 ith his feet, and so it w 7 as over¬ 
turned: no one else had any thing to do v T ith it.” The cow r herds w r ere 
exceedingly astonished at this account. 11 

One day the child repeatedly disobeyed his mother and she 
became angry. 

Fastening a cord round his w r aist, she tied him to the wooden mortar 
Ulukhala, and being in a great passion, she said to him, “Now, you 
naughty boy, get av T ay from hence if you can.” She then went to her 
domestic affairs. As soon as she had departed, the lotus-eyed Krishna, 
endeavouring to extricate himself, pulled the mortar after him to the 
space between the two ariuna trees that grew 7 near together. Having 
dragged the mortar between these trees, it became wedged awry 
there, and as Krishna pulled it through, it pulled down the trunks of 
the trees. Hearing the crackling noise, the people of Vraja came to 
see w T hat w r as the matter, and there they beheld the tw r o large trees,

with shattered stems and broker, branches, prostrate on the ground, 
with the child fixed between them, with a rope round his belly, 
laughing, and showing his little white teeth, just budded . . . The 
elders of the cowherds . . . looked upon these circumstances with 
alarm, considering them of evil omen. “We cannot remain in this 
place." said they, "let us go to some other part of the forest." 

Thus, they go to Yrindavana, exactly where the child had 
wished. The Harivamsha explains the move to Yrindavana in this 
way: 


Krishna converts the hairs of his body into hundreds of wolves, who 

so harass and alarm the inhabitants of Yraja—the said cowherds—. 

that they determine to abandon their homes. 12 

In the Indian myth, for once, the episode of Krishna's hairs turn¬ 
ing into hundreds of wolves seems a mere trifle, compared with 
Kullervo’s wolves which “he sang to cattle, and he changed the 
bears to oxen." the more so. as Krishna’s only "harass and alarm" 
the cowherds. These wild beasts, however, indispensable to the 
"Urkind." whether Kullervo or Dionysos—see above, p. 30—are 
present in Krishna's story, and this is remarkable enough. 

Kansa, 13 hearing of the deeds of Krishna and Rama, determines to 
have the boys brought to his capital Mathura and there to procure 
their death, if he cannot slay them before. Needless to say. all is in 
vain: Krishna kills Kansa and all his soldiers, and places Kansa's 
father on the throne. 

Krishna does not pretend to be a fool, the smiling one. He merely 
insists again and again on being a simple mortal when everybody 
wishes to adore him as the highest god. which he is. Nor is he 
known particularly as an "avenger." He was delegated from higher 
quarters to free the earth—“overburdened" as it was with Asura— 
as he had done time and again in his former avatars. Krishna belongs 
here, however, because Indian tradition has preserved the con¬ 
sciousness of the cosmic frame, and it is this alone that gives mean-

ing to the incidence of war and the notion of crime and punishment 
as they appear in myth. 

It is useful to keep philosophy and mythology carefully sepa¬ 
rated, and yet the many gods and heroes who avenge their fathers 
—beginning with “Horus-the-avenger-of-his-father” and “Ninurta 
who has avenged his father”—have their function destined to them, 
as has the long line of wicked uncles. These figures pay reparation 
and atonement to each other for their mutual injustice in the order 
of time, as Anaximander said. Anaximander was a philosopher. 
Despite its fantastic language the Indian epic has an affinity with his 
thought. Vishnu returns regularly in his capacity of “avenger,” 
collecting the “reparations” of the bad uncle “according to the 
order of time.” In the Mahabharata he does so under the name of 
Krishna, but he will come again in the shape of another avatar to 
clean the earth of the Asura who overburden it. The Asura, too, 
grow into “overbearing characters” strictly according to the order 
of time. Under the name of Kalki the Vishnu figure is expected to 
introduce a new Krita Yuga (Golden Age), when our present Kali 
Yuga has come to its miserable end. 

It is this regular returning of avatars of Vishnu which helps 
clarify matters. Because it is Vishnu’s function to return as avenger 
at fixed intervals of time, there is no need in the epic to emphasize 
the revenge taken by Krishna on Uncle Kansa. But in the West, 
where the continuity of cosmic processes as told by myth has been 
forgotten—along with the knowledge that gods are stars—the very 
same revenge is given great importance because it is an unrepeated 
event accomplished by one figure, whether hero or god, and this 
hero or god is, moreover, understood to be the creation of some 
imaginative poet. The introduction of Indian tradition makes it 
possible to rediscover the context in which such characters as 
Saxo’s Amlethus, such typically unlucky fellows as Kullervo, have 
significance. Once it is fully realized that “the day Krishna shall 
have departed from the earth will be the first of the Kali Yuga,” 
the proper perspective is established. Our hero stands precisely on 
the threshold between a closed age and a new Time Zero. In fact, 
he closes the old one. 








83 • The Unfolding in India 

The most inconspicuous details become significant when ob¬ 
served from this point of view. For instance Saxo, without giving 
it much thought, divided the biography of Amlethus in two parts 
(incidentally involving the hero in bigamy), in the same way as 
Firdausi told us nine-tenths of Kai Khusrau’s adventures in the 
book on Kai Ka’us. This is actually the more puzzling of the two 
as Firdausi states: ‘‘For from today new feasts and customs date / 
Because tonight is born Shah Kai Khusrau.” Firdausi, who was well 
versed in astrology, insisted on the Shah’s birthday because, in the 
astrological sense, birth is the decisive moment. But here, and in 
related cases where chronology is at issue, it is the moment of 
death, of leaving the stage, that counts. Krishna’s departure gives 
the scheme away. Al-Biruni, in his chapter on ‘‘The Festivals of 
the Months of the Persians,” describing the festival Nauroz (“New 
Day”) in the first month of spring, writes: 

On the 6th day of Farwardin, the day Khurdadh, is the Great Nau¬ 
roz, for the Persians a feast of great importance. On this day—they 
say—God finished the creation, for it is the last of the six days . . . 
On this day God created Saturn, therefore its most lucky hours are 
those of Saturn. On the same day—they say—the Sors Zarathustrae 
came to hold communion with God, and Kai khusrau ascended into 
the air. On the same day the happy lots are distributed among the 
people of the earth. Therefore the Persians call it “the day of hope." 14 

The so-called Kaianian Dynasty—the “Heroes” according to 
Al-Biruni’s Chronology 15 —succeeding the first Pishdadian Dynasty 
(“the Just”), is supposed to have started with Kai Kubad, his son 
Kai Ka’us, and the latter’s grandson Kai Khusrau, and to have 
ended with Sikander, Alexander the Great, with whose death a new 
era actually began. But it is obvious that something new begins 
with Kai Khusrau’s assumption into heaven. Thus, the Warners 
state that with our Shah “the old epic cycle of the poem comes to 
an end, and up to this point the Kaianian may be regarded as the 
complement of the Pishdadian dynasty.” 16

Hamlet’s Mill • 84 

In his introduction to the Firdausi translation, however, the 
Warners claim that the poem is divided into two periods, one 
mythic, the other historic: 17 

This distinction is based not so much on the nature of the subject- 
matter as on the names of the chief characters. At a certain point in 
the poem the names cease to be mythic and become historic. The 
mythic period extends from the beginning of the narrative down to 
the reigns of the last two Shahs of the Kaianian dynasty . . . The 
Shahs in question are Dara, son of Darab, better known as Darius 
Codomanus, and Sikander (Alexander).” 18 

Firdausi makes it clear that the mythic period ends only with the 
death of Alexander, the two last Shahs being Darius Codomanus 
and Alexander who overcame him. After him begins the “historic” 
period of the poem. In other words, “history” begins only when the 
Iranian empire vanishes from the scene, to be replaced by the suc¬ 
cessors of Alexander. To remove from history the great and solidly 
historical feats of Darius I, Xerxes, Cambyses, etc., is paradoxical 
for a poem which is meant to celebrate the Iranian empire. Pre¬ 
sumably Firdausi meant that so long as the Zoroastrian religion 
reigned, time was holy and thus belonged to myth rather than 
ordinary history. This is confirmed by a strange statement of the 
Warners: “Rightly or wrongly, Zoroastrian tradition couples Alex¬ 
ander with Zahhak and Afrasiyab as one of the three arch-enemies 
of the faith.” 19 

The great myths of the Avestan religion have overcome chronol¬ 
ogy and reshaped it to their purpose. The true kings of Persia have 
disappeared notwithstanding their glory, and are replaced by myth¬ 
ical rulers and mythical struggles. Kai Khusrau rehearses a “Jam- 
shyd” role in his beginnings, and with his ascent to heaven—the 
date of which marks New Year from now on—the Holy Empire 

17 The time structure is a very complicated one, and we cannot manage with a 
subdivision of two “periods” at all, the less so, as the reigns of the Shahs overlap 
with the rather miraculous lifetimes of the “heroes” or Paladins (Rustam, Zal, etc.). 
The same goes for the “primordial” emperors of China and their “vassals.” But 
God protect us from meddling with lists of alleged “kings” from whichever area, 
but particularly from the Iranian tables!

really comes to a close. The struggle has been between gods and 
demons throughout. 

We have been following the story of powers coming to an end, 
embodied first in the Iranian then in the Indian “kings,” a story 
which is differently emphasized by two different legends. Each 
legend has a disturbing similarity to the other, and each removes 
the narration from any known classic pattern, forcing the events 
to a catastrophic conclusion which is clearly commanded by Time 
itself, and by a very different chain of causes than that indicated 
by the actual sequence of events in the texts. 

To avoid misunderstanding it should be emphasized that it is not 
possible yet to know precisely who is who, or to make positive 
identifications such as saying that Brjam is Yudhishthira or Krishna. 
But the hints provided by Iranians and Indians may lead to a better 
understanding of Kullervo (“Kaleva is reborn in him”), and may 
indicate that the feat of the doggish fool Brutus in driving out the 
Kings was significant on a higher level than the political. This is 
not to deny that the Kings were expelled, but rather to point to 
a special set of firmly coined “figures of speech” derived from 
“large” changes or shifts (such as the onset of Kali Yuga) that 
could be, and were, applied to minor historical events.
