In Xanadu did Kubla Khan 
A stately pleasure dome decree 
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran 
Through caverns measureless to man 
Down to a sunless sea.

J-he ground, indeed, is not only sensitive but difficult and shift¬ 
ing as well. If the whirlpool turns up in the theory of the Cross, it 
is certainly without the consent of theologians. Yet the instances so 
far given are not isolated ones. It is necessary to deal with material 
which may appear suspicious to the trained historical reader, who is 
bound to be wary of omne ignotum pro magnifico. One should, 
therefore, preface this chapter with a small case history, which may 
show the infrangible tenacity of certain kinds of transmitted ma¬ 
terial, fragments of a sort official memory is prone to dismiss or 
neglect. 

In the Gospel of Mark hi. 17, the “twins” James and John, the 
sons of Zebedee, are given by Jesus the name of Boanerges, which 
the Evangelist explains as meaning “Sons of Thunder.” 1 This was 
long overlooked but eventually became the title of a work by a 
distinguished scholar, too soon forgotten, Rendel Harris. Here the 
Thunder Twins were shown to exist in cultures as different as 
Greece, Scandinavia and Peru. They call to mind the roles of Magni 
and Modi, not actually called twins, but successors of Thor, in 
Ragnarok. But to quote from Harris: 

1 Kai epetheken autois onoma Boanerges, ho estin hyioi brontes.

We have shown that it does not necessarily follow that when the 
parenthood of the Thunder is recognised, it necessarily extends to 
both of the twins. The Dioscuri may be called unitedly, Sons of Zeus; 
but a closer investigation shows conclusively that there was a ten¬ 
dency in the early Greek cults to regard one twin as of divine paren¬ 
tage, and the other of human. Thus Castor is credited to Tyndareus, 
Pollux to Zeus . . . The extra child made the trouble, and was credited 
to an outside source. Only later will the difficulty of discrimination 
lead to the recognition of both as Sky-boys or Thunder-boys. An 
instance from a remote civilization will show that this is the right 
view to take. 

For example, Arriaga, in his “Extirpation of Idolatry in Peru” tells 
us that “when two children are produced at one birth, which they 
call Chuchos or Curi, and in el Cuzco Taqui Hua-hua, they hold it 
for an impious and abominable occurrence, and they say, that one of 
them is the child of the Lightning , and require a severe penance, as if 
they had committed a great sin.” 

And it is interesting to note that when the Peruvians, of whom Ar¬ 
riaga speaks, became Christians, they replaced the name of Son of 
Thunder, given to one of the twins, by the name of Santiago, having 
learnt from their Spanish (missionary) teachers that St. James (San¬ 
tiago) and St. John had been called Sons of Thunder by our Lord, a 
phrase which these Peruvian Indians seem to have understood, where 
the great commentators of the Christian Church had missed the 
meaning . . . 

Another curious and somewhat similar transfer of the language of the 
Marcan story in the folk-lore of a people, distant both in time and 
place . . . will be found, even at the present day, amongst the Danes 
. . . Besides the conventional flint axes and celts, which commonly 
pass as thunder-missiles all over the world, the Danes regard the fossil 
sea-urchin as a thunderstone, and give it a peculiar name. Such stones 
are named in Sailing, sebedaei- stones or s'bedaei; in North Sailing 
they are called sepadeje- stones. In Norbaek, in the district of Viborg, 
the peasantry called them Zebedee stones! At Jebjerg, in the parish 
of Cerum, district of Randers, they called them sebedei-stones . . . 
The name that is given to these thunderstones is, therefore, very well 
established, and it seems certain that it is derived from the reference 
to the Sons of Zebedee in the Gospel as sons of thunder. The Danish 
peasant , like the Peruvian savage , recogjiised at once vchat voas ??ieant 
by Boanerges , and called his thunderstone after its patron saint . 2 

This might have given pause to later hyperscholars like Bult- 
mann, before they proceeded to “de-mythologize” the Bible. One 
never knows what one treads underfoot. Conversely, it shows that

some misunderstanding beyond the knowledge of the experts must 
be accounted for before one deals with the whole information. 
Thus, there is no intention to dismiss the abundant legends and 
runes dealing with the wood of the Cross. Lack of time, however, 
does not allow for a proper investigation, 3 and permits only some 
remarks on Finnish and Russian notions about the “Great Oak,” 
which is the nearest “relative” of Sumerian trees. Says one of the 
Finnish runes: “Long oak, broad oak. What is the wood of its 
root? Gold is the wood of its root. The sky is the wood of the 
oak’s summit. An enclosure within the sky. A wether in the en¬ 
closure. A granary on the horn of the wether.” 4 The next version 
boldly puts “the granary upon the top of the cross.” According to 
a further version, in the crown of the oak is a cradle with a little 
boy, who has an axe upon his shoulder. More stunning notions 
occur in a Russian Apocryph where Satanael planted the tree in 
the paradise intending to get out of it a weapon against Christ: 
“The branches of the tree spread over the whole paradise, and 
it also covered the Sun. Its summit touched the sky, and from its 
roots sprang fountains of milk and honey.” 5 

This latter idea in its turn fits the medieval tradition according 
to which the rivers of Paradise gushed forth from under the Cross. 
There will be other bewildering “trees” in the chapter on Gilga- 
mesh, but there also no attempt will be made to exhaust the huge 
and ambiguous evidence. 

But with the caveats distilled from the Sons of Thunder, and 
similar instances, it is possible to deal with more outlandish data. 
First, there is in the Atharva Veda, a whole hymn dedicated to 
what may be called the world pillar (a highly multivalent pillar), 
called the skambloa from which—see above, p. 111—the Finnish 
Sampo is derived. At this point only one verse will serve, in which 
the fiery monster of the deep is mentioned: 6

6 To prevent relentless experts from pointing to “fundamental” investigations 
which are, no doubt, unknown to us: the chapter on yaks a in Pischel and Geldner’s 
Vedische Studien is not unknown to us; there are several momentous reasons why 
we prefer to stick to the “obsolete” submarine “monster.” 




Hamlet’s Mill • 228 


AV 10. 7.38. A great monster [yaksa} in the midst of the creation, 

strode in penance on the back of the sea—in it are set whatever gods 

there are, like the branches of a tree roundabout the trunk. 

Or, to take a testimony from “late” astrological sources, these 
statements given by the Liber Hermetis Trismegisti which became 
so famous in the Middle Ages, to the degrees of Taurus (Gundel, 
pp. 54 f., 2i 7 ff.): 

18-20° oritur Navis et desuper Draco viortuus, vocatur Terra 
rises the Ship, and on it the dead Dragon, called Earth 

21-23° oritur qui detinet navem, Deus disponens universum mundwn 
rises he who keeps (or detains) the ship, the God that orders 
the whole universe. [Disponere corresponds to Greek kos- 
uteo. ] 

Whatever it is that rules “below” seems, indeed, a truly omnipo¬ 
tent entity: There are, after all, very few, if any, characters who 
are simply said to “order the whole universe.” 

This remarkable “kosmokrator” will be dealt with; the fiery 
creature deep down in the sea, however, has to be banished into 
an appendix. That it is relevant to the whole scheme can be seen 
from the fact that “Vainamoinen in the mouth of the whirlpool 
boils like fire in the water” 7 (appendix #19). 

The words of Hermes-Three-Times-Great, cryptic as they sound, 
are part of the highly organized technical language of astrologers; 
we mean not those who cast people’s fortunes for pay, but those 
who speculated on the traditional system of the world, and made 
use of whatever there was of astronomy, geography, mythology, 
holy texts of the laws of time and change, to build up an ambitious 
system. Abu Ma’shar and Michael Scotus were later dismissed as 
triflers, false prophets, and magicians, but Tycho and Kepler still 
held them in high esteem: they represented whatever there was 
of real science in the 13th century, and produced many dar¬ 
ing thoughts. The ignotum may conceivably turn out to be 
magnificuin.

The few disconnected sayings quoted may be called lacking in 
sense and method. They will be shored up with more material. Actu¬ 
ally, we had to sentence this chapter—once “swelling” enough to 
burst every seam—to the most meager of diets until it shriveled to 
its present state of emaciation and apparent lack of coherence. But 
first, one should understand what the latent geometrical design can 
imply, as it broke through, time and again, in the past chapters.
