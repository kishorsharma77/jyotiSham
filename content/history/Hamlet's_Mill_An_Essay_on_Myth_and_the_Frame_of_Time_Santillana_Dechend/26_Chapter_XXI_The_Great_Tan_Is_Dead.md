i VF.RYONF. has once read, for it comes up many times in litera- 
ture, of that pilot in the reign of Tiberius, who, as he was sailing 
along in the Aegean on a quiet evening, heard a loud voice an¬ 
nouncing that “Great Pan was dead.” This engaging myth was 
interpreted in two contradictory ways. On the one hand, it an¬ 
nounced the end of paganism: Pan with his pipes, the demon of still 
sun-drenched noon, the pagan god of glade and pasture and the 
rural idyll, had yielded to the supernatural. On the other hand the 
myth has been understood as telling of the death of Christ in the 
19th year of Tiberius: the Son of God who was everything from 
Alpha to Omega was identified with Pan — “All.” 1 

Here is the story, as told by a character in Plutarch’s dialogue 
“On why oracles came to fail” (419 b-e) : 

The father of Aemilianus the orator, to whom some of you have 
listened, was Epitherses, who lived in our town and was my teacher 
in grammar. He said that once upon a time in making a voyage to 
Italy he embarked on a ship carrying freight and many passengers. 

1 O. Weinreich (“Zum Tode des Grossen Pan,” ARW /5 [1910] pp. 467-73) has 
collected the evidence for such strange notions, first found in 1549 (Guillaume 
Bigot), then three years later in Rabelais’ Pantagrnel , and ridiculed in later times, 
e.g., by Fontenelle, in the beginning of the 18th century: “Ce grand Pan qui 
meurt sous Tibere, aussi bien que Jesus-Christ, est le Maistre des Demons, dont 
l’Empire est ruine par cette mort d’un Dieu si salutaire a l’Univers; ou si cette expli¬ 
cation ne vous plaist pas, car enfin on peut sans impiete donner des sens contraires 
a une mesme chose, quoy qu’elle regarde la Religion; ce grand Pan est Jesus-Christ 
luy-mesme, dont la mort cause une douleur et une consternation generate parmy les 
Demons, qui ne peuvent plus exercer leur tirannie sur les hommes. C’est ainsi qu’on 
a trouve moyen de donner a ce grand Pan deux faces bien differentes” (Weinreich, 
pp.472-73).

lr was already evening when, near the Echinades Islands, the wind 
dropped and the ship drifted near Paxi. Almost everybody w r as av r ake, 
and a good many had not finished their after-dinner wine. 

Suddenly from the island of Paxi v T as heard the voice of someone 
loudly calling Thamus, so that all were amazed. Thamus w r as an 
Egyptian pilot, not known by name even to many on board. Twice 
he was called and made no reply, but the third time he answered; 
and the caller, raising his voice, said, “When you come opposite to 
Palodes, announce that Great Pan is dead.” On hearing this, all, 
said Epitherses, w T ere astounded and reasoned among themselves 
whether it w T ere better to carry out the order or to refuse to meddle 
and let the matter go. Under the circumstances Thamus made up his 
mind that if there should be a breeze, he w'ould sail past and keep 
quiet, but with no wind and a smooth sea about the place he w r ould 
announce w hat he had heard. So, when he came opposite Palodes, and 
there w T as neither w ind nor w r ave, Thamus from the stern, looking 
toward the land, said the w T ords as he heard them: “Great Pan is 
dead.” Even before he had finished there w*as a great cry of lamenta¬ 
tion, not of one person, but of many, mingled w T ith exclamations of 
amazement. As many persons w r ere on the vessel, the story w T as soon 
spread abroad in Rome, and Thamus w T as sent for by Tiberius Caesar. 
Tiberius became so convinced of the truth of the story that he caused 
an inquiry and investigation to be made about Pan; and the scholars, 
w T ho were numerous at his court, conjectured that he w T as the son 
born of Hermes and Penelope. 

Plutarch has not been accepted, and a “simple” explanation was 
suggested. As the ship drifted along shore by a coastal village, the 
passengers were struck by the ritual outcry and lamentations made 
over the death of Tammuz-Adonis, the so-called grain god, as was 
common in the Middle East in high summer. Other confused shouts 
were understood by the pilot Thamus as directed to him. 2 Out of 
that, gullible fantasy embroidered the tale, adding details for credi¬ 
bility as usual. This sounded good enough. The story had been 
normalized, that is, disposed of as insignificant. 

One is still allowed to wonder why such a fuss was made at the 
time about exclamations which must have been familiar to contem¬ 
poraries, and why, unless Plutarch be a liar, that most learned of 
mythologists, the Emperor Tiberius himself, thought the matter 
worth following up.

J. G. Frazer, The Dying God (Golden Bough 3), pp. 7f. 






277 * The Great Pan Is Dead 

Therefore, with all due respect for the scholars involved, it is 
worth trying a different tack. One can assume that it was not all 
background noise, as we say today, but that there was an actual 
message filtered through: “The Great Pan is dead,” Pan ho vie gas 
tethneke, and that it was Thamus who had to announce it. 

It was enough of a message for Tiberius’ committee of experts 
( philologoi ) to decide that it referred to Pan, the son of Penelope 
and of Hermes, number 3 in Cicero’s list given in De natura deorum 
y.j 6. 3 Penelope, whoever she really was, must have had quite a life 
after the events narrated in the Odyssey . 4 Mythology seems to have 
been a careful science in those circles. 

If it is decided to credit the message, one is led to consider a num¬ 
ber of similar stories, some of them collected by Jacob Grimm, 
but the bulk by Mannhardt. 5 They are strictly on the level of 
folktale, which at least preserved their innocence from literate in¬ 
terference. There is a whole set of stories from the Tyrol concerning 
the “Fanggen,” a kind of “Little People” (or giants), dryads or tree 
spirits whose existence is bound to trees, so that the felling of such 
a tree would annihilate a Fangga. They were once willing to live 
with peasants in the form of servant maids and would bring bless¬ 
ings to the home, 6 but would also vanish unaccountably. A favorite 
story is that of the master of the house coming home and telling 
the family of a strange message that he has heard from a voice, such 
as “Yoke-bearer, yoke-bearer, tell the Ruchrinden [Rough-bark] 
that Giki-Gaki is dead on the Hurgerhorn,” or “Yoke-bearer, 

3 Tertius Jove tertio natus er Maia, ex quo et Penelopa Pana natum ferunt. Cf. 
also Herodotus 2. 145. 

4 As concerns the version according to which Pan was the son of Penelope and 
all the suitors, Preller remarks ( Griechische Mythologie [1964], vol. 1, p. 745): ‘‘the 
repulsive myth.” 

5 J. Grimm, TM, pp. 45372., 141 sfcf. pp. 989, 1011-12 (“The Devil's dead, and 
anyone can get to heaven unhindered”); W. Mannhardt, Wald- und Feldkulte, 
vol. 1 (1875), pp. 89-93; vol. 2 (1877), pp. 148!!. 

6 Generally, however, they are claimed to show rather revolting habits, such as 
eating children or disposing of them in another peculiar manner, as, for instance, 
pulverizing them into snuff. Thus, of one Fangga it is said: “Wenn sie kleine Buben 
zu fassen bekam, so schnupfte sie dieselben, wie Schnupftabak in ihre Nase, oder 
rieb sie an alten diirren Baumen, die von stechenden Aesten stamen, bis sie zu 
Staub geraspelt waren.” It seems to be a very deep-seated desire of “higher powers” 
to change divine or human beings into powder and dust. 





Hamlet’s Mill • 278 

yoke-bearer, tell the Stutzkatze [also Stutzamutza, i.e., Docked Cat] 
Hochrinde [High-bark] is dead.” At which point the housemaid 
breaks into a loud lament and runs away forever. 

Or it might be that while the family was sitting at dinner, a voice 
called three times through the window: “Salome, come!” and the 
maid vanished. This story has a sequel: some years later a butcher 
was coming home at midnight from Saalfelden through a gorge, 
when a voice called to him from the rocky wall: “Butcher, when 
you come to such and such a place [zur langen Unkener Wand], 
call into the crack in the rock: ‘Salome is dead.’ ” Before dawn the 
man had come to that point, and he shouted his message three times 
into the crack. And at once there came from the depths of the 
mountain much howling and lamentations, so that the man ran 
home in fear. Sometimes the message delivered is followed by the 
“flyting” of whole tribes of Little People: it was their “king” whose 
death had been announced. 7 It is remarkable that in most of the 
cases registered, the master was addressed as “Yoke-bearer.” No 
one knows why. But the wild woodmaid invariably vanished. 

Felix Liebrecht speaks of the ways of certain ghostly were¬ 
wolves, the “Lubins,” that haunted medieval Normandy. These 
timid ghosts hunted in a pack, but to little point, for instead of turn¬ 
ing on the intruder, they would disperse at the slightest noise, 
howling: “Robert est mort, Robert est mort.” 8 This meaningless 
yarn gains perspective once its trail is followed back to the “Wolf- 
Mountain” in Arcadia and the Lycaean “Wolf-games”—the parent- 
festival of the Lupercalia in Rome—held on this Mountain Lykaios. 
Pan is said to have been born here, 9 and here he had a sanctuary. 
Here also Zeus tilted a “table”—whence the place had the name 
Trapezous—because Lykaon had served him a dish of human meat, 

7 “No is Pippe Kong dod” (Schleswig); otherwise “Konig Knoblauch” (King 
Garlic), “King Urban”; “Hipclpipel is dead” (Lausitz); “Mutter Pumpe is tot” 
(Hessen). Cf. Grimm, p. 453; K. Simrock, Hand buck der Deutschen Mythologie 
(1869), § 125, pp. 4i6fF. Liebrecht, Zur Volkskimde (1879), p. 25772., who gives 
additional references. See also P. Herrmann, Deutsche Mythologie (1898), pp. 89L

top of the mountain was a temenos of Zeus, where nothing and nobody cast a

consisting of his own son. Zeus turned Lykaon into a werewolf, and 
in tilting the “table” caused the Flood of Deukalion, the “table,” of 
course, being the earth-plane through the ecliptic. This is the sig¬ 
nificant event of the tale, and the whole is so long no sensible person 
would try to summarize it. 

Next, there is the case of Robert, known as Robert le Diable, 
allegedly a historical character who was supposed to have spells as 
a werewolf and then to do penance by “lying in the guise of a dog 
under the ladder.” And thereby hangs the puzzle of the dynasty 
of the Scaligeri in Verona (we all remember Prince Escalus in 
Romeo and Juliet ) whose powerful founder was Can Grande della 
Scala, “Great Dog of the Ladder,” who became a host to Dante 
wandering in exile, and a patron of the Divine Comedy. His succes¬ 
sors, Mastino, Cansignorio, had dog names too. 10 Now, for the pur¬ 
poses of this essay, this is the end of this line of approach, except 
for two hints for the future. First, Pythagoras called the planets 
“the dogs of Persephone.” Second, there is only one huge ladder, 
the Galaxy, and only one canine character lying under this ladder, 
Sirius. But at this point we are only ringing bells at random. 

What matters here is the tenacious survival of motifs in simple 
surroundings. Moving one step down in folklore, there is a story 
spread all over northern Europe (Mannhardt /, 93) of which this 
is the English version (the end is from a German variant). A 
clowder of cats have met in an abandoned broken-down house, 
where a man is watching them unobserved. A cat jumps on the wall 
and cries: “Tell Dildrum that Doldrum is dead.” The man goes 
home and tells his wife. The house cat jumps up and yowls: “Then 
1 am king of cats!” and vanishes up the chimney. 

This is how the “body” of tradition survives the death of its 
“soul,” fractured, with all ideas gone, preserved like flies in amber. 
Greek gods have become cats and housemaids among illiterate folk; 
the Powers pass, but the information remains. By checking on the 
repeats, one has the message of the Voice in the canonic form: 
“Wanderer, go tell Dildrum that the Great Doldrum is dead.” The 

10 See O. Hofler, “Cangrande von Verona und das Hundesymbol der Lango- 
barden,” in Festschrift Fehrle (1940), pp. 107-37.

hearer of the message may be an unknown pilot, a passerby, an 
animal, a watcher. The substance is that a Power has passed away, 
and that the succession is open. The cosmos has in its own way 
registered some key event. 

For another example of hardly credible survival, there are 
also the findings of Leopold Schmidt on “Pclops and the Hazel 
Witch,” 11 a collection of tales from the Alpine valleys of South¬ 
ern Tyrol. It is again about housemaids among peasants. The story 
goes that a farm servant accidentally watches the dinner of some 
witches, in which a housemaid is boiled and consumed by her 
fellow witches. A rib is thrown at the young man, and when 
after the meal the witches rebuild and revive the girl, this rib 
is missing and has to be replaced by a hazel branch. At the very 
moment that the farmhand tells his master that his housemaid is 
a hazel witch, the housemaid dies. This is no witch hazel trick— 
it is simply a rehearsing of the archaic tale of Pelops, son of Tanta- 
los, the Titan, who had been boiled and served for dinner by his 
evil father at the table of the gods. The gods, it is said, kept away 
from the food that looked suspicious, all except for Demeter, who, 
lost in her grief for the death of Persephone, absently ate a shoulder 
blade believing it to be mutton. The gods brought the child back to 
life. But a shoulder blade was missing and it was replaced by ivory. 
Pelops went on to become a famous hero, from whom the Pelopon- 
nesos was named, and he won the foot race at Olympia from King 
Oinomaos, thus inaugurating the Olympian games. The two are 
portrayed before the race on the metope of the temple of Zeus in 
Olympia. Oinomaos stands there looking stuffy, Pelops relaxed, and 
above the two the great figure of Apollo with arms outstretched, 
as if to consecrate the event. But Olympia became holy because it 
was the site where Zeus overcame his father Kronos 12 and threw 
him down out of the royal chariot. Near Olympia you can see the

12 Paus. 5.7.10. It is not from mere “religious” motifs that “in the hippodrome 
the pillar which marked the starting point had beside it an altar of the Heavenly 
Tivi?is” (Pind. Olympian Odes 5.56; Paus. 5-/5); cf. F. M. Cornford in Harrison 
(Themis [1962], p. 228); see also above, pp. 2o6f. n. 5, for the Circus Maximus in 
Rome.

Kronion hill, which still bears the imprint of the celestial posterior. 
Exeunt the official characters. Only the great Olympic Games re¬ 
mained an “international” event which took place every four years 
and became the Greek way of counting time. What has all that to 
do with a little fairy housemaid in the Austrian Alps, thousands of 
years later? Nothing at first glance, and yet, if one dug deeper into 
the story of this shoulder blade, there would be a good case history 
to be made. 13 Tradition goes on tenaciously, even through ages of 
submerged knowledge. At least, by now, some distance has been 
made well away from the fertility rites of Frazer and others, which 
accounted for things too patly. This is an important gain. 

Returning to Plutarch’s text the dialogue’s chatty style gives an 
impression of casualness, but in these matters Plutarch usually knew 
more than he cared to discuss. There was a pilot, a kybernetes, giv¬ 
ing an announcement from the stern deck ( prumne) of his ship. 
These details seem not to be casual. For there is one stern and one 
pilot which cannot be overlooked in mythology. The stern is that 
of the constellation Argo, a ship which consists of a stern and little 
else. It is understood to be the Ship of the Dead with Osiris on 
board (he is the strategos of the ship, according to Plutarch’s Isis 
and Osiris 359 ef), and the Pilot star in the stern is Canopus itself, 
the site of the great Babylonian god Ea (Sumerian Enki), its name 
in Sumerian being mul NUN ki , and Enki is the father of Tammuz, 
which might lead back to the trail. 

But the striking thing is that Mesopotamian Canopus bears the 

13 There is not only “moskhou omon chryseion,” the golden shoulder of the ox 
in the hands of Mithras (Egyptian Maskheti, the Bull’s Thigh, Ursa Major), and 
Humeri, an antiquated Latin name of Orion, as we know from Varro; the highest 
god, Amma, of the West Sudanese Dogon (or the Clcirias senegalensis, the shadfish, 
an avatar of the Dogon’s “Moniteur Faro,” whose emblem is the very same as 
that of ityphallic Min, the Egyptian Pan) carries in his humeri the first “eight 
grains,” and these 8 sorts of grain (stereotypically including beans) play their 
cosmogonic role from the Dogon to China (cf. for another striking similarity of 
West Sudan and China, the chapter on the “shamanistic” drums, but there are 
many more). There is also the tale from modern Greece (see J. G. von Hahn, 
Griechische und Albanische M'drchen [1918], vol. /, pp. 181-84) of the “Son of 
the shoulder-blade,” one of those “Strong Boys” who, after adventures in spirit 
land, grinds his mother to porridge on a hand mill. How these and other traditions 
are connected with the shoulder blade oracle, if they are connected at all, cannot 
be made out yet.

name “Yoke-star of the Sea” 14 —the “Yoke-star of the Sky” being 
Draco. 11 ere then there is a death fate, a pilot, and a yoke-bearer 
in an unsuspected but suggestive complex. Dealing with such pro¬ 
found experts of archaic myth as Plato and Plutarch, one is not 
likely to overlook the “Egyptian king Thamus” in Phaedrus (274c- 
27511, see below, chapter XXIII), who drives it home to Thot- 
Hermcs, who was very proud of just having invented writing, that 
this new art was an extremely questionable gain. It must have been 
a mighty “king” who dared to criticize Mercury’s merits. But then, 
the chapter on the Galaxy and the fall of Phaethon will have shown 
that geographical terms are not to be taken at their face value, least 
of all “Egypt,” a synonym of the ambiguous Nile. 

To find something more about the substance of the message we 
shall move many centuries back, to a text certainly ancient, but of 
undetermined date. It is the so-called “Nabataean Agriculture” 
which has little to do with farming but much to do with agrarian 
rites. The author, Ibn Wa’shijja, claimed to have derived it from an 
almost primordial Chaldean source. 15 Modern critics have decided it 
was a fabrication of uncertain origin, a so-called falsification. What¬ 
ever else it may be, original it is not. Such things are built out of tra¬ 
ditional material. Maimonides judged it worth quoting at length, 
Chwolson and Liebrecht analyzed it, comparing it with An- 
Nadim’s report on the Tammuz festival of the Harranians, held in 
the month of July and called el-Buqat, the “weeping women.” 16 
Here first is a passage studied by Liebrecht: 17 

14 See P. F. Gossmann, Flanetarium Babylonicum (1950), 281; J. Schaumberger, 
in Kugler’s 3. Ergdnzwigsheft (1935), p. 325, and n. 2 (one version: the “yoke of 
Ea”); P. Jensen, Die Kosmologie der Babylonier (1890), pp. i6ff., 25; F. Boll- 

C. Bezold, Farbige Sterne (1916), p. 121. 

15 Actually, he (and others) claimed that the book was written by three (or 
even more) authors, namely Ssagrit, Janbushad, and Qutama. The first living in the 
seventh thousand of the 7000 years of Saturn—which he ruled together with the 
Moon—the second at the end of the same millennium, the third appeared after 4000 
years of the 7000-year cycle of the Sun had passed; so that between the beginning 
and the end of the book 18,000 solar years have passed (according to Maqrizi). See 

D. Chwolson, Die Sscibier und der Ssabismns (1856), vol. /, pp. 705E (cf. p. 822 for 
the special alphabet used by Janbushad). So we are up to another “Tris-megistos,” 
three tunes great, not just “thrice.” Time is involved. Hermes is repeated three 
times historically.

17 Z7/r Volkskunde , pp. 25if. 







283 * The Great Pan Is Dead 


It is said that once the Sakain (angels) and the images of the gods 
lamented over Janbushad, just as all Sakain had lamented over Tam- 
muz. The tale goes that the images of the gods gathered from all 
corners of the earth in the temple of the Sun, around the great golden 
image, which hung between heaven and earth. The great image of the 
Sun was in the middle of the temple, surrounded by the images of the 
Sun from everywhere, and also by the images of the Moon, then 
those of Mars, then those of Mercury, of Jupiter, of Venus, and 
finally of Saturn . 18 

Chwolson’s part of the text goes on: 

This idol (that hung between earth and heaven) fell down at this 
point and began to lament Tammuz and to recount his story of sor¬ 
rows. Then all the idols wept and lamented through the night; but on 
the rising of the morning star, they flew off and returned to their 
own temples in all corners of the world. 

Such is the story which, Liebrecht says, was rehearsed in the 
temples after prayers, with more weeping and lamentations. This 
is then the archaic setting. It concerns planetary gods, the great 
cult of Harran. Two of them stand out, almost ex aequo: Tammuz 
and Janbushad. Now this latter is no other than Firdausi’s Jam- 
shyd. 19 It has been seen already (p. 146) that Jamshyd is in Avestic 
Yima xsaeta, the name from which came Latin Saturnus. There is 
no question then, this is about Saturn/Kronos, the God of the 
Beginning, Yima (Indian Yama), the lord of the Golden Age. A 
lament over the passing of Kronos would have been in order even 
in Greece, 20 since he had been dethroned and succeeded by Zeus. 


18 Let us note that the planets are not given in the astronomical order of their 
periods, but in the order given by the heptagram, which describes the days of the 
week. 

19 See Liebrecht, p. 25172: “The Babylonian Izdubar [=Gilgamesh] is called 
by Ibn Wa’shijja’s Book on the Nabataean Agriculture ‘Janla-Shad’ (Janbushad), 
i.e. Jamshid . . . Thus Rawlinson in Athenaeum December 7, 1872.” 

20 Cf. the report by Plutarch (Isis and Osiris 363E) on Egypt: “There is also a 
religious lament sung over Cronus. The lament is for him that is born in the re¬ 
gions of the left, and suffers dissolution in the regions on the right; for the 
Egyptians believe that the eastern regions are the face of the world, the northern 
the right, and the southern to the left. The Nile, therefore, which runs from the 
south and is swallowed up by the sea in the north, is naturally said to have its 
birth on the left and its dissolution on the right.” Kronos having been the ruler 
of “galactical times” (Geb “inside” Nut), this makes more sense than meets the 
eye. See also chapter XIII, “Of Time and the Rivers.” 





Hamlet’s Mill • 284 


But who was Tammuz? The grain god dying with the season, the 
rural Adonis, would hardly fit into such exalted company. Now it is 
clear he was astronomical first of all. So much has been written 
about his fertility rites that it took time to locate the real date, given 
by Cumont. 21 The lament over Adonis-Tammuz did not fall simply 
in “late summer”: it took place in the night between July 19 and 20, 
the exact date which marked the opening of the Egyptian year, and 
remained to determine the Julian calendar. For 3000 years it had 
marked the heliacal rising of Sirius. 

Tammuz was extremely durable, for he is found in Sumer as 
Dumuzi, already the object of the midsummer lamentations. It was 
seen that he was worshiped as the son of Enki, who was the 
Sumerian Kronos. The cult went on in Harran as late as the 13th 
century, long after Mohammedanism had engulfed the Ssabian 
population. Notwithstanding the severe displeasure of the Caliph 
of Baghdad, it went through sporadic but intense revivals in an area 
that spread from Armenia to Quzistan. 22 As mentioned, the celebra¬ 
tion was called el-Buqat, “the weeping women.” And the lament 
was mainly over the god who was cruelly killed by being ground 
between millstones, just like John Barleycorn in the rhyme we 
quoted earlier: 23 

They roasted o'er a scorching fire 
The marrow of his bones 
But a miller used him worst of all 
For he ground him between two stones. 

What kind of grinding could it have been? Surely, the lament 
referred in popular consciousness to the death of a corn god, called 
also Adonis (the Lord), slain by a wild boar, but the celestial aspect

over “the king of the Djinns,” and over “Uncud, Son of the grape cluster”).

is predominant compared with the agrarian one, and more ancient, 
too; the more so as that “wild boar” was Mars. 24 

This leaves a knotted story to untangle. It is hampered consider¬ 
ably by too many “identifications” taken for granted by the scholars 
who with magnificent zeal have extirpated the dimension of time in 
the whole mythology. Actually, it is not known yet who Tammuz 
is. 25 He looks almost like a title, just as “Horus” was a title. There 
is doubt of his “identity”—as taken in the current sense—with 
Adonis, and with Osiris, 26 Attis, Balder, 27 and others. The “Naba¬ 
taean Agriculture” leaves no doubt that there were lamentations 
over Tammuz and Janbushad/Jamshyd. The Egyptians lamented 
on account of Kronos and AHneros 28 ( Herodotus 2, 79). Tammuz, 
after all, is not the only star who came to fall in the course of the 
Precession. (And was not King Frodhi a repetition of Freyr, Kai 
Khusrau a repetition of Jamshyd, as Apis was the repetition of 
Ptah [the Egyptian Saturn-Hephaistos], and Mnevis that of Ra?) 

This is a long way from Great Pan, and it is not clear yet who 
or what was supposed to have passed away in the time of Tiberius, 
that is, which “Pan.” Creuzer 29 claimed right away that he was Sirius 
—and any suggestion from Creutzer still carries great weight—the 
first star of heaven and the kingpin of archaic astronomy. And 

24 See Nonnos ^/.2o8fF. on Aphrodite: “Being a prophet, she knew, that in the 
shape of a wild boar, Ares with jagged tusk and spitting deadly poison was 
destined to weave fate for Adonis in jealous madness.” Cf. for the other sources, 
Movers, vol. /, pp. 222#. 

25 To give tiniest minima only: Tammuz = Saturn (Jeremias in Roscher s.v. 
Sterne, col. 1443); Tammuz = Mars (W. G. Baudissin, Adonis nnd Esmun 
[1911], p. 117, quoting the Chronicle of Barhebraeus). For the unheard-of number 
of names given to “Tammuz” in Mesopotamia, see M. Witzel, Tammuz-Liturgien 
(1935). For his name “Dragon of the Sky” (Usungal-an-na)= Sin (the Moon) see 
K. Tallqvist, Akkadische Gotterepitheta (1938), p. 482; see also p. 464, where 
Tammuz = “Mutterschafbild” (“mothersheep-image”). 

26 It is worth noticing that the death of Osiris, in his turn, was announced by 
“the Pans and Satyrs who lived in the region around Chemmis (=Ptf?zopolis), and 
so, even to this day, the sudden confusion and consternation of a crowd is called 
a panic” (Plutarch: Isis and Osiris, c. 14, 356D). 

27 All the gods of the North came together, in best “Nabataean” fashion, to weep 
over Balder’s death. 

28 We leave aside, though, the cases Linos, Maneros, Memnon, Bormos, etc. See 
Movers, vol. /, p. 244.

Hamlet’s Mill • 286 


Aristotle says ( Rhet. 2. 24, 1401 a 15) that, wishing to circumscribe 
a “dog,” one was permitted to use “Dog-star” (Sirius) or Pan, 
because Pindar states him to be the “shape-shifting dog of the 
Great Goddess” (O makar, home me gal as theon kyna pantodapon 
kaleousin Olympioi ). 30 But this is far enough for now. The amazing 
significance of Sirius as leader of the planets, as the eighth planet, 31 
so to speak, and of Pan, the dance-master (choreutes) as well as 
the real kosmokrator, ruling over the “three worlds,” 32 would take 
a whole volume. The important point is that the extraordinary 
role of Sirius is not the product of the fancy of silly pontiffs, but 
an astronomical fact. During the whole 3000-year history of Egypt 
Sirius rose every fourth year on July 20 of the Julian calendar. In 
other words, Sirius was not influenced by the Precession, which 
must have led to the conviction that Sirius was more than just one 
fixed star among others. And so when Sirius fell, Great Pan was 
dead. 

Now, Creuzer had no monopoly on deriving from Egypt the 
ideas connected with Pan, nor has the derivation been invented in¬ 
dependently here. W. H. Roscher undertook this task in his article 
on “The Legend of the Death of the Great Pan,” 33 being convinced 

30 See also Plato’s Cratylus 408B: ton Pana tou Hermou einai hyon diphye echei 
to eikos. 

31 Creuzer takes Pan-Sirius for Eshmun/Shmun, “the eighth,” great god of 
Chemmis. 

32 Cf. the Orphic Hymn to Pan (no. 11; see also Hymn 34.25): Pana kalo 
krateron, nomion, kosmoio to sympan/ ouranon ede thalassan ide chthona pam- 
basileian/ kai pyr athanaton . . . Echous phile . . . pantophyes, genetor panton, 
polyonyme daimon/ kosmokrator ... As concerns his love for Echo, Alacrobius 
(Sat. 7.22.7) explains it as harmony of the spheres: quod significat harmoniam 
caeli, quae soli arnica est, quasi sphaerarum omnium de qui'ous nascitur moderatori, 
nec tamen potest nostris umquam sensibus deprehendi. But then, Alacrobius was 
the first among the “sun-struck” mythologists, harmlessly claiming Saturn and 
Jupiter and everybody else, including Pan, to be the Sun. It is not the echo itself 
which is the harmony of the spheres but the syrinx—Pan makes it out of the reeds 
into which his beloved Echo had changed—and the seven reeds of Pan’s pipe are 
indeed the seven planets, the shortest representing the Moon, the longest Saturn. 
(It is worth consideration that in China the echo was understood as the acoustical 
pendant to the shadow, so that under the pillar or tree, in the very center of the 
world, the kien-mu, there is no echo and no shadow.) 

33 “Die Legende vom Tode des Grossen Pan,” in Fleckeisens Jahrbiicher fur klas- 
slsche Philologie (1892), pp. 465-77. Referring to the “Panic” element in Mann- 
hardt’s stories about the Fanggen, Roscher declares it “an accidentally similar 
motif.”

that the myth could not be understood by means of Greek ideas and 
opinions, the less so, as Herodotus (2.145) informs us of the 
following: 

In Greece, the youngest of the gods are thought to be Heracles, 
Dionysos, and Pan; but in Egypt Pan is very ancient, and once one 
of the “eight gods” who existed before the rest; 34 Heracles is one of 
the “twelve” who appeared later, and Dionysos one of the third order 
who were descended from the twelve. I have already mentioned the 
length of time which by the Egyptian reckoning elapsed between the 
coming of Heracles and the reign of Amasis; Pan is said to be still 
more ancient, and even Dionysos, the youngest of the three, appeared, 
they say, 15000 years before Amasis. They claim to be quite certain 
of these dates, for they have always kept a careful written record of 
the passage of time. But from the birth of Dionysos, the son of 
Semele, daughter of Cadmus, to the present day is a period about 1600 
years only; from Heracles, the son of Alcmene, about 900 years; from 
Pan, the son of Penelope—he is supposed by the Greeks to be the son 
of Penelope and Hermes—not more than about 800 years, a shorter 
time than has elapsed since the Trojan war. 35 

These details are given, without meddling with them, in order to 
draw attention to the modest numbers; whoever takes these elapsed 
years for historical ones, 36 presupposes a special Egyptian (and 
Babylonian, Indian, etc.) frame of mind, a human nature, in fact, 
which is fundamentally different from ours, forgetting that we are 
all members of the very same species, Homo sapiens.

the sensible 17th century, at the beginning of the 19th century still, the progressive 
delusion was remarkably underdeveloped.
