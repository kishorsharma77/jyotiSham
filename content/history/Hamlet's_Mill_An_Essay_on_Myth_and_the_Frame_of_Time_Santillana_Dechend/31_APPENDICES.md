## Appendix I 


The only master of this kind of observation hitherto has been Marcel 
Griaule (d. 1956) but he left an impressive cohort of disciples. They 
have renewed the understanding of African studies, showing that such 
systems are still alive with the Dogon, whom Griaule “discovered,” in 
the true sense of the word. 

As Germaine Dieterlen writes: “The smallest everyday object may 
reveal a conscious reflection of a complex cosmogony . . . Thus for in¬ 
stance African techniques, so poor in appearance, like those of agri¬ 
culture, weaving and smithing, have a rich, hidden content of signifi¬ 
cance . . . The sacrifice of a humble chicken, when accompanied by 
the necessary and effective ritual gestures, recalls in the thinking of 
those who have experienced it an understanding that is at once original 
and coherent of the origins and functioning of the universe. 

“The Africans,” she continues, “with whom we have worked in the 
region of the Upper Niger have systems of signs which run into thou¬ 
sands, their own systems of astronomy and calendrical measurements, 
methods of calculation and extensive anatomical and physiological 
knowledge, as well as a systematic pharmacopoeia. The principles un¬ 
derlying their social organization find expression in classifications which 
embrace many manifestations of nature. And these form a system in 
which, to take examples, plants, insects, textiles, games and rites are dis¬ 
tributed in categories that can be further divided, numerically expressed 
and related one to another. It is on these same principles that the politi¬ 
cal and religious authority of chiefs, the family system and juridical 
rights, reflected notably in kinship and marriages, have been established. 
Indeed, all the activities of the daily lives of individuals are ultimately 
based on them.” 1 

It goes without saying that we need not subscribe to the author’s 
opinion that the Mande peoples invented “their own systems of astron¬ 
omy ...”

## Appendix 2 


The father of Saxo’s Amlcthus was Horvandillus , written also Oren- 
dcl, Ercntcl, I'arcndcl, Ocrvandill, Aurvandil, whom the appendix to 
the Hchicvbuch pronounces the first of all heroes that were ever born. 
The few data know n about him are summarized by Jacob Grimm: 1 

I Ic suffers shipwreck on a voyage, takes shelter with a master fisher¬ 
man Eiscn, 2 earns the seamless coat of his master, and afterwards 
wins frau Breide, the fairest of women: king Eigel of Trier was his 
father’s name. The whole tissue of the fable puts one in mind of the 
Odyssey: the shipwrecked man clings to a plank, digs himself a hole, 
holds a bough before him; even the seamless coat may be compared 
to Ino’s veil, and the fisher to the swfneheard, dame Breide’s templars 
w ould be Penelope’s suitors, and angels are sent often, like Zeus’s 
messengers. Yet many things take a different turn, more in German 
fashion, and incidents are added, such as the laying of a naked sw T ord 
betw een the newfy married couple, which the Greek story know T s 
nothing of. The hero’s name is found even in OHG. documents: 
Orendil . . , Orentil ... a village Orendelsal, now Orendensall, in 
Hohenlohe . . . But the Edda has another myth, which w r as alluded 
to in speaking of the stone in Thor’s head. Groa is busy conning her 
magic spell, when Thorr, to requite her for the approaching cure, 
imparts the welcome new 7 s, that in coming from Jotunheim in the 
North he has carried her husband the bold Orvandill in a basket on 
his back, and he is sure to be home soon; he adds by w T ay of token, 
that as Orvandil’s toe had stuck out of the basket and got frozen, 
he broke it off and flung it at the sky, and made a star of it, which is 
called Orvandils-ta. But Groa in her joy at the tidings forgot her spell, 
so the stone in the god’s head never got loose (Snorri’s Skaldskap. 17). 

Powell, 3 in his turn, compares the hero to Orion in his keen interpre¬ 
tation: 

The story of Orwandel (the analogue of Orion the Hunter) must 
be gathered chiefly from the prose Edda. He was a huntsman, big 
enough and brave enough to cope with giants. He was the friend of 
Thor, the husband of Groa, the father of Swipdag, the enemy of the

(1845), p. ix. 

2 Also written Ise or Eise, and derived from Isis, by Simrock; considering that the 
fisherman s modest home has seven towers, with 800 fishermen as his servants, Ise/ 
Eisen looks more like the Fisher King of Arthurian Romances.

giant Coller and the monster Sela. The story of his birth, and of his 
being blinded, are lost apparently in the Teutonic stories, unless we 
may suppose that the bleeding of Robin Hood till he could not see, 
by the traitorous prioress, is the last remains of the story of the great 
archer’s death. Dr. Rydberg regards him and his kinsfolk as doublets 
of those three men of feats, Egil the archer, Weyland the smith, and 
Finn the harper, and these again doublets of the three primeval artists, 
the sons of Iwaldi, whose story is told in the prose Edda. 

It is not known which star, or constellation, Orvandils-ta was sup¬ 
posed to be. Apart from such wild notions as that the whole of Orion 
represented his toe 4 —to identify it with Rigel, i.e., beta Orionis, would 
be worth discussing—even Reuter tries to convince himself that Corona 
borealis “looks like a toe,” 5 because he could not free himself from the 
fetters of seasonal interpretation of myth, nor dared he attack the ro¬ 
mantic authority of Ludwig Uhland who had coined the dogma that 
Thor carried the sign for spring in his basket; accordingly a constella¬ 
tion had to be found which could announce springtime, and Reuter, 
choosing between Arcturus and Corona, elected the latter. 

It is not his toe alone, however, which grants to Hamlet’s father his 
cosmic background: some lines of Cynewulfs Chidst dedicate to the 
hero the following words: 

Hail, Earendel, brightest of angels thou, 
sent unto men upon this middle-earth! 

Thou art the true refulgence of the sun, 
radiant above the stars, and from thyself 
illuminest for ever all the tides of time. 6 

The experts disagree whether Earendel, here, points to Christ, or to 
Alary, and whether or not Venus as morning star is meant, an identifica¬ 
tion which offers itself, since ancient glosses render Earendel with 
“Jubar ,” 7 and Jubar is generally accepted for Venus on the presupposi¬ 
tion that “morning star” stands every single time for Venus, which is 
certainly misleading: any star, constellation or planet rising heliacally 
may act as morning star. With respect to juba, i.e., literally “the mane

of any animal,” jubar, “a beaming light, radiance,” we have, however, 
Varro’s clear statement: “iuba dicitur Stella Lucifer.” 8 Nonetheless, sev¬ 
eral experts arc against the equation Orendel/Earendel = Venus. 9 
Gollancz abstains from precise identifications, but he procures the one 
more existing piece of evidence concerning the word Earendel: 

In Anglo-Saxon glosses “earendel” ... or “oerendil” is interpreted 
jubar, but “dawn” or “morning star” would probably be a better 
rendering, as in the only other passage known in old English litera¬ 
ture, viz" the Blickling Homilies (p. 163, 1. 3): “Nu seo Cristes 
gebyrd at his aeriste, se niwa eorendel Sanctus Johannes; and nu se 
leoma thaere sothan sunnan God selfa cuman wille”; i.e., And now 
the birth of Christ (was) at his appearing, and the new day-spring 
(or dawn) was John the Baptist. And now the gleam of the true Sun, 
God himself, shall come. 10 

Orendel/Earendel, then, seems to be the foremost among those which 
announce some “advent,” not unlike the passage in the Odyssey (/5.93L) 
dealing with Odysseus’ arrival in Ithaca: “When that brightest of 
stars ( aster phatintatos) rose which comes to tell us that the dawn is 
near, the travelling ship was drawing close to an island.” That might 
point, again, to Venus, but there are reasons to think of Sirius, the 
brightest of all fixed stars, as will come out later. 

Another subject of discussion has been the etymology of the name, and 
since the identity of Orendel might depend on its etymology, we have 
to look into the matter, at least superficially. Jacob Grimm admitted 
freely: 

I am only in doubt as to the right spelling and interpretation of the 
word: an OHG. orentil implies AS. earendel, and the two would 
demand ON. aurvendill, eyrvendill; but if we start with ON. orven- 
dill, then AS. earendel, OHG. erentil would seem preferable. The 
latter part of the compound certainly contains entil — wentil. 11 The 
first part should be either ora, eare (auris), or else ON. or, gen. orvar 
(sagitta ). Now, as there occurs in a tale in Saxo Grammaticus . . . , a 
Horvendilus filius Gervendili, and in OHG. a name Kerwentil. . . and

II In a footnote, Grimm asks (and we wish we knew the answer!): “Whence did 
Matthesius [in Frisch 2 , 439 s ] get his Tan is the heathens’ Wendel and head bag¬ 
piper?’ Can the word refer to the metamorphoses of the flute-playing demigod? 
In trials of witches, Wendel is a name for the devil, Mones anz. 8, 124.” 









357 * Appendices 

Gerentil . . , and as geir (hasta) agrees better with dr than with eyra 
(auris), the second interpretation may command our assent; a sight 
of the complete legend would explain the reason of the name. I think 
Orentil’s father deserves attention too: Eigil is another old and ob¬ 
scure name . . . Can the story of Orentil’s wanderings possibly be so 
old amongst us, that in Orentil and Eigil of Trier we are to look for 
that Ulysses and Laertes whom Tacitus places on our Rhine? The 
names show nothing in common. 

Scherer (p. 179) states shortly: “Earendel does not belong to ausos 
‘dawn,’ nor to OE. ear ‘ear’ (Ahre), but to OE. ae , ear m. ‘wave, sea,’ 
ON. aurr ‘humidity.’ ” Gollancz, who is inclined to connect Earendel 
with Eastern ( ushas , eos , aurora , etc.), mentions more current deriva¬ 
tions, among which also that from aurr “moisture,” and from the root 
signifying “to burn” in Greek, euo, Latin uro, Ves-uvius, etc. Decisive 
seems to us the derivation from or — arrow, suggested by Grimm, and 
by Uhland, who explained Orendel as the one “who operates with the 
arrow” (in contrast to his grandfather, Gerentil, who worked with the 
ger = spear), and Simrock gives the opinion that the very gloss “Earen¬ 
del Jubar” designates Earendel explicitly as “beam” (or “ray”), “which 
still in MHG. and Italian means ‘arrow.’ ” 12 

Simrock did more. Taking into consideration that in the Heldenbuch 
Orendel is spelled Erendelle, and at some other place Ernthelle, he 
thinks it probable that u Em ” was dropped as epitheton ornans, 13 and he 
concludes from there that the story of Tell shooting the apple from the 
head of his son was once told of Orendel himself. That the historical (?) 
Tell was not the inventor of this famous shot, or even performed it, 
seems rather certain. As Grimm aptly stated: 

The legend of Tell relates no real event, yet, without fabrication or 
lying, as a genuine myth it has shot up anew in the bosom of Switzer¬ 
land, to embellish a transaction that took hold of the nation’s inmost 
being. 14 

Now there is no arrow to be found that could contest with Sirius in 
mythical significance. We know mul KAK.SI.DI, the “Arrow-Star” from 

12 Handbuch der Deutschen Mythologie (1869), § 82, p. 233. 

13 Ibid. See also Simrock, Die Quellen des Shakespeare (1870), pp. 129!.: “Dies 
ward aber wohl in Tell gekiirzt, weil man die erste Silbe fiir jenes vor Namen 
stehende ‘Ehren’ ansah, das nach dem d. Worterb, III 52 aus ‘Herr’ erwachsen, bald 
fiir ein Epitheton ornans angesehen wurde.” 

14 TA 1 5, p. xxxiv. 





Hamlet’s Mill • 358 


Sumer, as well as “Tishtriya,” the arrow from Ancient Iran—it is shot 
from a how built up by stars of Argo and Canis Major (Sumerian: 
mu, B \\). The very same bow is to be found in the Chinese sphere, but 
there the arrow' is shorter and aims at Sirius, the celestial Jackal, whereas 
the same Egyptian arrow is aimed at the star on the head of the Sothis 
Cow, as depicted in the so-called “Round Zodiac” of Dendera—Sirius 
again. In India, Sirius is the archer himself (Tishiya), and his arrow is 
represented by the stars of Orion’s Belt. And about all of them manifold 
legends arc told. Thus, “Earendel, brightest of angels thou,” might well 
point to the brightest among the fixed stars, Sirius. 

But even the derivation from the root aurr — moisture, ear = sea, 
w'ould not exclude Sirius. Quite the contrary. The Babylonian New 
Year’s ritual says: “Arrow Star, who measures the depth of the sea”; 
the Avesta states: “Tishtriya, by whom the waters count.” And as 
Tishtriya, “the Arrow,” watches Lake Vurukasha (see p. 215), so 
Teutonic Egil is the guardian of Hvergelmer, the whirlpool, and of 
Elivagar, south of which “the gods have an ‘outgard,’ a ‘saeter’ which 
is inhabited by valiant watchers —snotrir vikinger they are called in 
Thorsdrapa, 8—who are bound by oaths to serve the gods. Their chief 
is Egil, the most famous archer in the mythology. As such he is also 
called Orvendel (the one busy with the arrow).” 15 

We had better stop getting diffuse concerning Sirius the Arrow and 
his role as guardian and as “measurer of the depth of the sea”; the few 
hints that were given here must suffice to show the level at which to 
look for the father of Hamlet. 

Since, however, we can never resist the temptation to quote beautiful 
poems, we have still to confess our suspicion that the “Stella Maris” is 
Sirius too. Enough is known about Isis/Sirius as guardian-deity of navi¬ 
gators, to whom belongs the “carra navalis,” and was it not “Mary or 
Christ” who was addressed with “Hail, Earendel”? In the same manner, 
the hymn “In Annunciatione Beatae Mariae” begins with the verses: 

Ave, mavis Stella 
Dei mater alma 
atque semper virgo 
felix caeli porta 

15 V. Rydberg, Teutonic Mythology (1907), pp. 424*?., 968ft. 







359 # Appendices 


Sumens illnd Ave 
Gabrielis ore 
fimda nos in pace 
mutans nomen Evae. 

And there is another hymn which was sung, according to the Roman 
Breviary, after Compline during Advent and Christmastide, and which 
has been ascribed to Herimanus Contractus of Reichenau (d. 1054), 
who would appear to have lived and died a cripple in his monastery: 

Alma redemptoris mater , quae pervia caeli 
porta manes et Stella maris , succurre cadenti , 
surgere qui curat , populo , tu quae genuisti 
(natura mirante) tuum sanctum genitorem , 

Virgo prius et posterius , Gabrielis ab ore 
sumens illud Ave , peccatorem miserere. 

“What I have been attempting to suggest,” says the interpreter of this 
hymn, 10 “is that the attraction of this charming mediaeval prayer and 
hymn would seem to come, in large measure, from the intentional am¬ 
biguity, the different levels of meaning, and the sunken imagery . . . 
The ‘nourishing mother’ is perhaps pictured as a fixed constellation in 
the heavens, or perhaps as the morning star, guiding those on the sea. 
She is a celestial passage-way, always passable and ever accessible . . . 
The falling and rising has now (besides the constantly falling sinners) 
perhaps the further overtones of heavenly bodies rising and falling, 
perhaps of ships rising and falling on the sea, and lastly of tottering 
children who need their mother’s help to walk . . . The poem ... is a 
very striking one, and its force derives, in my view, from the subtle 
imagery of the first three lines . . . They offer us a symbol, a verbal 
icon, of the entire situation of man on earth in his struggle to rise to 
the stars, of his need of an otherworldly force which is at once strong 
and loving.”

Journal $2 (1957), pp. 171-74.

## Appendix 5 


Now, apart from the circumstance that the snowy burial ascribed to 
the followers of Kai Khusrau, Enoch, and Quetzalcouatl could hardly 
be claimed to he an “obvious” feature, the fate of Quetzalcouatl’s com¬ 
panions might further our understanding; more correctly, the topos 
where this event is supposed to have happened might do so. The “five 
mountains” of Mexican myth, their “gods” respectively, the Tepicto- 
ton ,* appear to represent the five Uayeb (= Maya; with the Aztecs: 
Xcmontcmi), the Epagomena, those days gained bv Mercury from the 
Moon during a game of checkers, in order to help Rhea/Nut to days 
“outside of the year,” when she could bring forth the five planets. As a 
matter of fact, in his chapter on the clothes and emblems of the gods, 
Sahagun puts the “Mountain-Gods” at the end of the list . 2 

Worth mentioning might be two more traits which Quetzalcouatl 
shares with his old-world brethren: Quetzalcouatl and Uemac, like Kai 
Ka’us and Kai Khusrau, are said to have ruled together, and Quetzal¬ 
couatl is accused of incestuous relations with his sister, as were Hamlet, 
Kullervo, Yama and, we might add, King Arthur . 3 


Appendix 4 


It is as yet too early in the day to deal with “Uncle Kamsa,” whom 
lexicographers make a u mura-devaP allegedly a “venerator of roots” 
(miila/mura — root). In his Kleine Beitrdge (p. u), Jarl Charpentier 
earnestly wishes us to accept as fact that “among the Indian natives fight¬ 
ing against the invading Aryans, there were such,” namely, “venerators 
of roots” (and venerators of worms as well). Although we do not doubt 
that the species Homo sapiens is capable of any “belief,” we cannot

Paidewna 10 (1964), pp. 8of., 83. In this paper, Barthel has established, in a 
rather convincing manner, the presence of decans in Mexican astronomy.

perceive any cogent reason for subscribing to Charpentier’s view. 
Mula/mura , the “root,” is a Nakshatra, a lunar mansion woven around 
with tales: it is the sting of Scorpius, serving as Marduk’s weapon in the 
“Babylonian Genesis,” and as Polynesian Maui’s fishhook; with the 
Copts it is “statio translationis Caniculae . . . unde et Siot vocatur,” i.e., 
the Coptic table of lunar stations takes lambda upsilon Scorpii as the 
precise opposite of Sirius/Sot his, as we are informed by Athanasius 
Kircher, whereas Indian tables ascribe the role of exact opposition to 
Betelgeuse, ruled by “Rudra-the-destroying-archer.” Although we can¬ 
not pursue these and other tales further here, we think it at least appro¬ 
priate to mention the concrete problems arising with such characters as 
“Uncle Kamsa,” instead of accusing a true Asura of “veneration of 
roots.” 


Appendix 5

Gollancz ( Hamlet in Iceland , p. xi) retranslated his translation into 
Old Norse so that the original and the nolens volens interpreting transla¬ 
tion might be compared. The retranslation runs thus: kveda niu brud¬ 
ir eyludrs hraera hvatt hergrimmastan skerja grotta ut fyrir jardar skauti, 
thaer er fyrir longu molu Amloda lid-meldr; baugskerdir ristr skipa 
hlidar bol lungs bardi. Elton translates the passage: 

“Men say that the nine maidens of the island-mill (the ocean) are 
working hard at the host-devouring skerry-quern (the sea), out beyond 







I Iamlet’s Mill • 362 

the skirts of the earth; yea, they have for ages been grinding at Am- 
lodi's meal-bin (the sea)." 1 

Rydberg, too, oilers a translation: 

“It is said, that Eyludr’s nine women violently turn the Grotte of 
the skerry dangerous to man out near the edge of the earth, and that 
those women long ground Amlode’s //d-grist.” 2 

In spite of the trickiness and the traps of the text Gollancz tries to 
solve the ease; in fact, he tries too frantically (p. xxxvi): “The com¬ 
pound cy-ludr, translated ‘Island-Mill,’ may be regarded as a synonym 
for the father of the Nine Maids. Ludr is strictly ‘ the square case 'within 
'which the lower and upper Quernstones rest, 1 hence the mill itself, or 
quern.” 

With this we w ish to compare O. S. Reuter’s explanation: U ludr — 
Miihlengebalk (dan. Luur — das Geriist zu einer Handmuhle )” ( Ger - 
vianische Himmelskunde, p. 239; he also includes a drawing of the mill). 
On p. 242, note, he renders the lines of Skaldskap. 25: “Neun Scharen- 
briiute riihren den Grotti des Inselmiihlkastens (eyludr) draussen an 
der Erde Ecke (ut fyrir jardar skauti),” adding: “Das (kosmische?) 
Weltmeer ist als ‘Hamlets Miihle’ gesehen.” At least he thought, even if 
within brackets and with a quotation mark, of “cosmic”—Rydberg is 
the only one who has grasped this point completely. 

“Ey-ludr,” Gollancz continues, “is the ‘island quern,’ i.e., ‘the grinder 
of islands,’ the Ocean-Mill, the sea, the sea-god, and, finally, Aegir. 
‘Aegir’s daughters’ are the surging waves of the ocean; they work 
Grotti ‘grinder,’ the great Ocean-Mill (here called ‘skarja grotti,’ the 
grinder of skerries, the lonely rocks in the sea), ‘beyond the skirts of 
the earth’ or perhaps, better, ‘off yonder promontory.’ The latter mean¬ 
ing of the words ‘ut fyrir jardar skauti’ would perhaps suit the passage 
best, if Snaebjorn is pointing to some special whirlpool.” Non liquet: 
neither Aegir = eyludr, nor the nine maidens = waves, whether surg¬ 
ing or not. 

As concerns “off yonder promontory” which sounds ever so poetical 
and indistinct, see J. de Vries: 3 skaut n. Ecke, Zipfel, Schoss, Kopftuch,

wegen, trotz, fur .. . —lat. prae “voran, voraus,” lat. prior “der friihere” 
—which tells us either nothing at all or, if we take “prior” for the 
proper translation, tells us the whole “story” by means of one single 
word; in the same manner as the mere fact that the pillars of Hercules 
were “fyr,” called the pillars of Briareos, and before that time, the pil¬ 
lars of Kronos. 

We stick, however, to Gollancz for some more lines. “The real dif¬ 
ficulty,” he says, “in Snorri’s extract from Snaebjoern is ... in its 
last line; the arrangement of the words is confusing, the interpreta¬ 
tion of the most important of the phrases extremely doubtful. ‘Lid- 
meldr’ in particular has given much trouble to the commentators: 
‘meldr,’ at present obsolete in Icelandic, signifies ‘flour or corn in the 
mill’; but the word 7 id* is a veritable crux. It may be either the neuter 
noun ‘lid,’ meaning ‘a host, folk, people,’ or ship, or the masculine 
7 idr? ‘a joint of the body.’ The editors of the Corpus Poeticum Boreale 
read ‘meldr-lid,’ rendering the word ‘meal-vessel’; they translate the 
passage, ‘who ages past ground Amlodi’s meal-vessels = the ocean’; 
but ‘ mala ,’ ‘to grind,’ can hardly be synonymous with ‘ hraera, ‘to 
move,’ in the earlier lines, and there would be no point in the waves 
grinding the ocean. There seems, therefore, no reason why meldr-lid 
should be preferred to lid-meldr, which might well stand for ‘ship- 
meal’ (sea-meal), to be compared with the Eddie phrase ‘graedis 
meldr,’ i.e., sea-flour, a poetical periphrasis for the sand of the shore. 
Rydberg [Teutonic Mythology (1907), pp. 57off. = pp. 388-92 in the 
1889 edition], bearing in mind the connection of the myth concerning 
the fate of Ymer’s descendant Bergelmer, who, according to an inge¬ 
nious interpretation of a verse in Vafthrudnismal ‘was laid under the 
millstone,’ advanced the theory that ‘lid-meldr’ means ‘limb-grist.’ 
According to this view, it is the limbs and joints of the primeval giants, 
which in Amlodi’s mill are transformed into meal . . . Snorri does not 
help us. The note following Snaebjoern’s verse merely adds that here 
the sea is called “Amlodi’s kvern.’ ” 

In a note Gollancz adds that in some other manuscript he found the 
version: “Here the sea is called ‘Amlodi’s meal’” (Atnloda melldur ), 
and concludes: “No explicit explanation is to be found in early North¬ 
ern poetry or saga. ‘Hamlet’s Mill’ may mean almost anything.” It is 
not as bad as that. Moreover, Gollancz (p. xvii, note) detected more 
relevant figures of speech in the four lines cited below which he

ascribes to Snaebjorn: “The island-mill pours out the blood of the flood 
goddess’s sisters (i.c., waves of the sea), so that (it) bursts from the

Appendix 6 


It is not as easy to dispose of My sing, as the specialists pretend, e.g., 
by preferring to interpret his name as “mouse-gray” instead of the 
equally possible “son of a mouse.” Olrik (pp. 459f.) proposes to identify 
straightaway “King Mysing who killed Frith-Frothi, and the cow that 
struck down Frothi the Peaceful . . . King Mysing is merely a rational¬ 
istic explanation of the ancient monster.” (For the death of Frodi by 
means of a sea cow, see also P. Herrmann’s commentary on Saxo, 
pp. 380-84. This “cow”—in Iceland they remain within the frame of 
zoology and make it a stag—was, according to Saxo, a witch, who was 
pierced through by Frodi’s men. Afterwards they kept Frodi’s death a 
secret for three years, in the same manner as told by Snorri in his 
Heimskringla about Frey.) 

A. H. Krappe, more obseryant, compared Mysing with Apollon 
Smintheus, the old “mouse-god” (ARW 55 [1936], pp. 40-56). He had 
in his mind, however, only the connection—undeniable as it is—between 
mice and rats and the plague, and the dragging-in of Smintheus does 
not much further the understanding of Mysing. This state of things 
was changed with the publication of the work by Henri Gregoire, R. 
Goossens and M. Matthieu, A-Vsklepios, Apollon Smintheus et Rudra: 
Etudes sur le dieu a la taupe et le dieu au rat dans la Grece et dans 
1 Inde,’ although they do not even mention our Mysing, and although 
they loudly praise (p. 157) the merit of “Meillet . . . d’avoir fait

descendre la mythologie du ciel sur la terre”; with Rudra, and with the 
rat of Ganesha (who, by the way, acquired his elephant’s head because 
the planet Saturn, not being invited to the infant’s “baptism,” had 
looked upon the baby with his evil eye, thus destroying his head which 
was successfully replaced by that of an elephant), the mouse plot has 
got much deeper background. Nevertheless, the identity and the role 
of the mouse deity is hardly going to be settled without taking into 
account (1) “the tailed Alus Parik, arrayed with wings; the Sun fet¬ 
tered her to his own ray, so that she could not perpetrate harm; when 
she becomes free, she will do much injury to the world, till she is 
recaptured, having come eye-to-eye with the Sun”; this enigmatical 
winged mouse comes from the world horoscope in the Iranian Bimda- 
hishn (chapter V, A, Anklesaria translation, p. 63); (2) the colorful 
Polynesian myths dealing with the rat that gnawed through the “Nets 
of Alakalii,” i.e., Hyades and Pleiades; she could do so unpunished being 
Makalii’s very own sister; (3) the warriors, in the guise of mice, of 
Llwyd, son of Cil Coed, “who cast enchantment over the seven cantrefs 
of Dyfed ... to avenge Gwawl son of Clud,” in the third branch of the 
Alabinogi. There are more items, to be sure, but we have to leave it 
at that. 


Appendix 7 

We want to stress the point that the haughty verdicts as given by 
Genzmer, Olrik, and others on Snorri’s tale are not unknown to us. Their 
opinions run along these lines: “The last part of the story of Grotti and 
Alysing is ‘How the sea grew salt.’ This is a different motif, in no wise 
connected with the peace of Frothi.” 1 Genzmer’s wording is more 
arrogant still. The transportation of the mill by Alysing and the grind¬ 
ing of salt aboard the ship is “die Anschweissung einer zweiten selb- 
standigen Sage; der grossartig einfache, ahnungsvolle Schluss unserer 
Dichtung wird durch ein solches Anhangsel todlich geschadigt.” 2 

It would be more adequate to state that the myth has been “fatally 
damaged” by the modern experts, and not by Snorri. When we come to

the litrle salr-mill of Kronos, the reader will understand the plot better. 
Olrik (pp. 45 7 f.), however, has some pretty survivals to offer: 

In 1895, Dr. Jakob Jakobsen, the well-known collector of the rem¬ 
nants of the ancient “Norn” language of the Western Islands, was 
informed by an old Shetlander, whose parents had come from the 
Orkneys (Ronaldsev) that near the most northerly of these islands 
there was an eddy called “the Swelki” [that is, Snorri’s svelgr, “sea- 
mill, where the waters rush in through the eye of the mill-stone”]. 
On that spot a mill stood on the bottom of the sea and ground salt; 
and a legend of Grotti-Fenni and Grotti-Menni was connected with 
it. In the course of later investigations in the Orkneys themselves 
(South Ronaldsev) he learned about the sea mill in the Pentland 
Firth grinding salt. In 1909, Mr. A. W. Johnstone was told by a ladv 
from Fair Isle that Grotti Finnie and Lucky Minnie were well known 
in her native island, being frequently invoked to frighten naughty 
children. Although the legend in those parts is in a fragmentary con¬ 
dition, reduced to incoherent survivals, the tenacity of the oral tra¬ 
dition shows how deeply rooted the legend is in these islands. Outside 
of the Orkneys neither Mysing nor his salt mill are known to tradi¬ 
tion except in the songs of the Edda which themselves bear the stamp 
of Western provenience. 


Appendix 8 


Vafthrudnismal 35 is rendered by Gering: “Ungezahlte Winter vor 
der Schopfung / geschah Bergelmirs Geburt. / Als friihestes weiss ich, 
dass der erfahrene Riese / Im Boote geborgen ward.” Simrock translates 
similarly, and he remarks ( Hdb. Dt. Myth., § 9): “Das dunkle Wort 
ludr fur Boot zu nehmen, sind wir sowohl durch den Zusammenhang 
als durch die Mythenvergleichung berechtigt.” 

R. B. Anderson (The Younger Edda [1880], pp. 6of.) translates the 
verse—quoted by Snorri ( Gylf . 7)—as follows: “Countless winters / 
Ere the earth was made, / Was born Bergelmer. / The first I call to 
mind / Flow the crafty giant / Safe in his ark lay.” 

Neckel and Niedner ( Die JUngere Edda , pp. 54L) state that Bergel¬ 
mer and his wife “stieg auf seinen Miihlkasten und rettete sich so.” The 
lines above they render with the words: “Als friihestes weiss ich, dass der 
vielkluge Riese in die FFohe gehoben ward,” adding in a footnote: “Das 
oben mit ‘Mahlkasten’ wiedergegebene Wort iibersetzt man gewohnlich

mit ‘Boot' oder auch mit TYiege,’ ohne Begriindung und gegen den 
YYortlaut der Prosa. Gegen den gewohnlichen Wortsinn ‘Mahlkasten 
(Muhlsteinbehalter auf Pfosten) spricht nichts. Freilich kennen wir 
den angedeuteten Yorgang des Xaheren nicht und wissen daher auch 
nicht, warum der Riese gehoben (‘gelegt’) werden musste, und wer 
ihn aufhob.” 

The ominous word ludr occurs again in Helgakvida Hundingsbana 
11, 2-4, where Plelge—seeking refuge from king Hunding—works in a 
milk disguised as a female, and almost wrecks the ludr. 

In common with the mythologists who defend the “boat.” in 
Vafthrudnismal 35, feeling entitled to it on account of comparative 
mythology (see Simrock, quoted some lines ago), and whom he fights 
explicitly, Rydberg upholds the notion that the Ark was a ship. It will 
come out later that this general notion is incorrect. 


Appendix p 

As a matter of fact, Simrock already (Handbuch der Deutschen M) - 
tbologie , pp. 240k) ventured to interpret Fengo (Amlethus’ evil uncle) 
as “the grinding." and Amlethus as “the grain”; “wo selbst der Name mit 
Amelmehl [Greek amyloji ], Starkemehl, Kraftmehl ubereinstimmt.” 
He even thought of the possibility (although taking this thought for 
audacious, “gewagt”) to derive the family name of Thidrek’s clan, i.e., 
the name of the Amelunge, from “Amelmehl.” We shan’t dwell upon 
the strange information given by Athenaeus (Deipnosophistai 5.114k) 
about “Achilles, or very fine barley” (cf. Theophr. 8 . 4.2. Aristoph. 
Eq. 819: Achilles cake), or on the surname of Xingishzida. namely 
Zid-zi “Meal of Life” (K. Tallqvist, Akkadiscbe G otter epithet a , p. 406; 
cf. Riemschneider. Augengott , p. 133), and we point only to Ras Shamra 
texts, where the lady Anat ground Mot. (See C. Gordon, Ugarhic 
Literature , p. 45.) H. L. Ginsberg (ANTT, p. 140) translates 1 ab, col. 11: 

She seizes the Godly Mot 
With s-jeords she does cleave him 
With jan she does vcinnov: him 
With fire she does burn him 






I Jam let’s Mill • 368 


With hand-mill she grinds him 
In the field she does sow him. 

Birds cat his remnants 
Consuming his portions 
Flitting from remnant to remnant. 

An astonished footnote states: “But somehow Mot comes to life entire 
in col. vi, and Baal even earlier.” But there is absolutely nothing aston¬ 
ishing enough to shake the firm belief of experts in “chthonic” deities. 


Appendix 10 


For the first Irish harp (emit), see Eugene O’Curry, On the Manners 
and Customs of the Ancient Irish, vol. 5 (1873), pp. 236b; see also Ru¬

Jahrhundert (1921), pp. 264b 

There once lived a couple . . . And the wife conceived a hatred to 
him, and she was flying from him through woods and wilderness; and 
he continued to follow her constantly. And one day that the woman 
came to the sea shore of Camas, . . . she met a skeleton of a whale on 
the strand, and she heard the sounds of the wind passing through the 
sinews of the whale on the strand, and she fell asleep from the sounds. 
And her husband came after her; and he perceived that it was from 
the sounds the sleep fell upon her. And he then went forward into the 
wood, and made the form of a Cruit; 1 and he put strings from the 
sinews of the whale into it; and that was the first Cruit that was ever 
made. 

Marbhan’s legend about the beginnings of instruments and verses 
continues: 

And again Lamec Bigamas had two sons, Jubal and Tubal Cain were 
their names. One son of them was a smith, namely, Jubal; and he dis¬ 
covered from sounds of two sledges (on the anvil) in the forge one 
day, that it was verses (or notes) of equal length they spoke, and he 
composed a verse upon that cause, and that was the first verse that 
was ever composed. 

1 u The word Cruit . . . signifies literally, a sharp high breast, such as of a goose, 
a heron, or a curlew” (O’Curry, loc. cit.). 






369 • Appendices 


The legend goes on to report, why the timpan —another stringed in¬ 
strument, different from the cruit—was called Timpan Naimh (or 
saint’s Timpan), because “at the time that Noah, the son of Lamech, 
went into the Ark, he took with him a number of instruments of 
music into it, together with a Timpan, which one of his sons had, who 
knew how to play it.” When they finally left the ark, Noah caused 
his son to name the instrument after his own name, and only under 
this condition would he give it to him. “So that Noah’s Timpan is its 
name from that time down; and that is not what ye, the ignorant 
timpanists, call it, but Timpan of the saints.” 

We introduce this legend for several reasons; first, because we felt 
reminded at once, as O’Curry did (p. 237), “of Pythagoras, who is 
said to have been led to discover the musical effect of vibrations of a 
chord by observing the sound of various blows on an anvil, though the 
Irish legend . . . does not appear to bear on the tones so much as on 
the rhythm of music.” Second, because here we learn again about two 
successive stringed instruments, separated, so to speak, by a flood; 
Vainamoinen lost his Kantele when going to steal the Sampo, and had 
to construct a new one from wood, afterwards. These traditions must 
be thoroughly compared, one day, with the different lyres of Greece; 
we know that one was destroyed by Apollon—allegedly in a fit of 
repentance—after he had flayed Marsyas, and that Hermes made an¬ 
other one and presented it to Apollon; pike and whale of the northern 
seas have apparently replaced the turtle of Greek myth. We also know 
that the Pleiades, called the Lyre of the Muses by the Orphics, existed 
side by side with Lyra. And iMichael Scotus still knew about a turtle 
figuring, so to speak, as prow of Argo, and “out of which the celestial 
lyre is made.” 2 But before being trapped between the devil and the 
deep sea, we prefer to stop, although this turtle seems to be placed 
exactly there, where it “should” be, considering that upon its back the 
Amritamanthana was accomplished. We shall hear more about that 
considerable and mysterious man, Michael Scotus, later (see p. 258). 

The long and the short of the various traditions is that with a new 
age new instruments, new strings, or, as in the case of Odysseus, a new 
peg are called for: a new “Harmony of the Spheres.”

Appendix 11 


Christensen, in his work on the Kayanids, 1 states: “La tradition na¬ 
tional fait grand cas du forgeron Kavag, qui s’insurgcait contre Fusur- 
patcur Dahag (le Dahaka dcs Yashts) et hissait son tablier de cuir sur 
tine lance, cc qui fut l’origine du drapeau de Fempire sassanide, appele 
draft e kavyan, ‘drapeau de Kavag.’ Cette legendc, nee d’un malentendu, 
la vraie signification du nom de drafs e kavyan etant ‘le drapeau royal,’ 
est inconnue dans la tradition religieuse.” 

Bv means of such statements—apart from “modestly” insinuating that 
Firdausi spun whole chapters of his Shahnama out of “malentendus”— 
the way to relevant questions is effectively blocked. The story of the 
smith Kavag—also written Kaweh, 2 or Kawa—is told by Firdausi in 
the book dealing with the 1000 years’ rule of Dahak, that fiendish tyrant 
out of whose shoulders grew two serpents 3 that had to be fed with the 
brains of two young men every day. The predestined dragon-slayer, 
and much expected savior, Faridun—Avestan Thraethona—a true pre¬ 
decessor of Kai Khusrau, had been saved from the snares of Dahak as a 
baby, and hidden away in the mountains. When the archdevil Dahak 
claimed the sacrifice of the last son of Kaweh—seventeen sons had 
already been fed to the dragon-heads—the smith started the revolution 
for the sake of Faridun: 

He took a leathern apron, such as smiths 
Wear to protect their legs while at the forge, 

Stuck it upon a spear's point and forthwith 
Throughout the market dust began to rise . . . 

He took the lead, and many valiant men 
Resorted to him; he rebelled and went 
To Faridun. When he arrived shouts rose. 

He entered the new prince's court, who marked

the Shahnama (Firdousi: Das Konigsbuch [1967]—so far, only Pt. 1, Bks. 1-5 have 
come out), H. Kanus-Crede boldly identifies the smith Kawa with “awestisch 
Kawata,” i.e., with Kai Kobad, the first Iranian ruler. 

3 Dahak with his two additional serpent heads is the same as the “powerful, rav¬ 
ing Dasa with his 6 eyes and 3 heads” of RV zo.99.6.: Visvarupa, son of Tvashtri, 
and “Schwestersohn der Asura”; cf. Mbh. *2.343 (Roy trans., vol. 10 , p. 572).

The apron on the spear and hailed the omen. 

He decked the apron with brocade of Rum 
Of jewelled patterns on a golden ground , 

Placed on the spear point a full moon—a token 

Portending gloriously—and having draped it 
With yellow , red , and violet , he named it 
The Kawian flag. Thenceforth when any Shah 
Ascended to the throne , and donned the crown , 

He hung the worthless apron of the smith 
With still more jewels , sumptuous brocade , 

And painted silk of Chin. It thus fell out 

That Kawa's standard grew to be a sun 

Amid the gloom of night , and cheered all hearts. 

Now, if there was only the “royal” flag to explain, why should Fir¬ 
dausi (or his sources) invent a smith with the name Kaweh (Kavag, 
Kawa), if there was no connection whatever between kingship and the 
smith? Even if we leave out of consideration the widely diffused motif 
of great smiths as foster-fathers and educators of the hero 4 as well as 
the Chinese mythical imperial smiths, and all the material collected by 
Alfoldi in his article on smith as a title of honor among the kings of 
Mongols and Turks: 5 the very name of the dynasty of Iranian kings 
which is of the greatest interest for us, i.e., the Kayanides, is derived 
from Kavi/Kawi. 6 The most “kawian” Shah is Kai Ka’us, whose 
name even contains the relevant word twice, the “Kavi Kavi-Usan,” 
who cannot be separated from Kavy Usa (or Usanas Kavya) of the 
Rigveda and the Mahabharata , 7 who shows several of the decisive char-

whose life was spared thanks to the rebellion, became a famous paladin of Faridun,

Usan and Rigvedian Kavy Usha is a precious gem in the collection of philological

w eapon for Indra 8 —instead of Tvashtri—and to have given Soma to 
Indr a who, otherwise, has stolen (or has just drunk) the Soma in the 
“House of Tvashtri" (c.g., RV 5.48.if.), but we are told that, during 
one of the never-ceasing w ars between Asura and Deva for the “three 
worlds," the Asura elected Kavva Ushanas for their “priest” or “mes¬ 
senger," 9 the Deva elected Brihaspati (or Vrihaspati, i.e., Jupiter, in 
Taittiriya Saiihita Agni). Many w*arriors were slain on both sides, but— 
so the Mahabharata tells—“the open-minded Vrihaspati could not revive 
them, because he knew not the science called Sanjivani (re-vivification) 
which Kavva endued with great energy knew so well. And the gods 
w ere, therefore, in great sorrow.” 10 The Bundahishn, in its turn, gives 
the follow ing report in chapter 32, dedicated to “the mansions which 
the Kayans erected with glory, which they call marvels and wonders,” * 11 
in verse n: “Of the mansions of Kay Us one says: ‘One was of gold 
where-in he settled, two were of glass in w hich w ere his stables, and 
two were of steel in which was his flock; there-from issued all tastes, 
and waters of the springs giving-immortality, which smite old-age,— 
that is, w'hen a decrepit man enters by this gate, he comes out as a youth 
of fifteen years from the other gate,—and also dispel death.” According 
to Firdausi, Kai Ka’us had a kind of balm by means of which he could 
have restored Shurab to life, but he did not give it to Shurab’s fathe r 
Rustem who implored him for this gift. 12 To which Lommel remar ks 


proposition to derive the name Usan from “usa- m. (i) Quelle, Brunnen; (2) Ab- 
fluss, Leek . . is no obstacle at all to the understanding of Kavy Usan. Kronos 
too has been derived from Greek krounos , i.e., “source,” “spring” (see Eisler, 
Weltemnantel , pp. 378.,, 385^ reminding us also of the Pythagorean formula con¬ 
cerning the sea: “Kronou dakryon, the tear of Kronos”).

166-70; for a life-restoring lake or well, owned by the “wicked Danavas,” see Mbh.

12 In the same manner. Lug—the strength and heart of the Tuatha De Danann 
as Krishna was that of the Pandava—denies the revivifying pig’s skin to Tuirill 
who, by means of it, could have restored to life his three sons, Brian, Juchair, and 
Jucharba.

(Melanges Bally, p. 212): “Und das ist der hiisslichste Zug im Bilde des 
Kay Kaus, dass er die Herausgabe des Wunderheilmittels verweigert, 
da Rostem und Sohrab, wenn beide am Leben waren, vereint ihm zu 
machtig waren.” It is a rather idle occupation to look for “ugly traits” 
in the “character” of the Demiurge, even if he comes our way in the 
disguise of a Shah. 

These few hints must suffice for now; it is bad enough that the burden 
of “proof” rests with the defenders of sense in our deteriorated century, 
whereas everyone who presupposes non-sense and “malentendus” can 
get away with the most preposterous claims. In other words: even if the 
individual Kaweh/Kavag should have been “invented” by Firdausi, the 
notion of the Deus Faber and Celestial Smith as the disposer and guard¬ 
ian of kingship, 13 as the original and legitimate owner of the “water of 
life,” 14 is by no means an accidental fancy, 15 and the significance and 
meaning of the smith’s apron as “Kawian flag” would have been under¬ 
stood from China to Ireland. 


Appendix 12 

It should be stressed that the disinclination of philologists to allow for 
the “essential” connection of Chronos and Kronos rests upon the stern 
belief that the “god” Saturn has nothing to do with the planet Saturn, 
and upon the supposition that an expert in classical philology has 
nothing whatever to learn from Indian texts. Were it not so, they might 
have stumbled over Kala, i.e., Chronos, as a name of Varna, i.e., Kronos, 
alias the planet Saturn. 

13 To repeat: the “Lord of the Triakontaeteris,” the period of thirty years, i.e., 
the Egyptian and Persian “Royal Jubilee'’ (Saturn’s sidereal revolution), is Ptah- 
Hephaistos. 

14 Also of the intoxicating beverage replacing it; Soma belonged to Tvasthri; Irish 
Goibniu brewed the ale which made the Tuatha De Danann immortal, and the 
beer of the Caucasian smith Kurdalogon played the same role. When Sumerian 
Inanna was almost lost in the underworld, it was Enki who gave to his messengers 
the life-restoring fluid with which to besprinkle the goddess. And, last but not 
least, it is Tane/Kane, the Polynesian Deus Faber, whose are “the Living Waters.” 

15 Leo Frobenius, when accused—as happened sometimes—of having been de¬ 
ceived by African informants who “made up” any amount of fairy tales which 
were not “true,” used to smile benevolently, and to point to what he called 
“stilgerechte Phantasies 





Hamlet’s Mill • 374 


Indians have indeed, written more about their Kala—and the Iranians 
about their Zurvan—than the Greeks about Chronos, but with the 
translated Vedas being what they are, we won’t claim the relevant texts 
to be transparent, nor the scholarly interpretations to be particularly 
elucidating, all of the experts starting, as they do, from the unfounded 
conviction that “astrology” must be a “late” phenomenon. 

To throw “identifications” around, does not lead anywhere, in our 
opinion, so we do not mean to simplify by nailing down, once and for 
all, Kala/Chronos as being the very same as Yama/Kronos/Saturn. To 
recognize Kronos/Saturn as anctor temporum is quite sufficient for the 
time being, 1 and so are the Indian notions, according to which Yama is 
often called Kala; in other passages he is the commander of Kala (and 
Kala, in his turn, the commander of Mrityu, Death). 2 

Kala plays his unmistakable role already in Rigveda 164, but the 
Atharva Veda dedicates to this u god” two whole hymns (19.53 and 
19. 54), and it is worth recalling Eisler’s statement (W eltenmantel, p. 
499): “Zu dieser Kala-Lehres des Atharvaveda ist spater nichts mehr 
dazugekommen; die jiingeren Quellen fiihren nur die Vorstellungen 
weiter aus.” 

Here are some verses from these two hymns dedicated to Kala, 
without the numerous notes and comparisons with other translations, as 
treated by Bloomfield and Whitney (Atharva Veda, trans. by Bloom¬ 
field [1964], pp. 224^): 

19.53: (1) Time, the steed, runs with seven reins (rays), thousand-eyed, 
ageless, rich in seed. The seers, thinking holy thoughts, mount him, all 
the beings (worlds) are his wheels. 

(2) With seven wheels does this time ride, seven naves has he, immor¬ 
tality is his axle. He carries hither all these beings (worlds). Time, the 
first god, now hastens onward. 

(3) A full jar has been placed upon Time; him, verily, we see existing 
in many forms. He carries away all these beings (worlds); they call him 
Time in the highest heaven. 

1 We do not think it is an “accident” that this originator of time begins with the 
letter X, representing the obliquity of the ecliptic in Plato’s Timaeus. 

2 See J. Scheftelowitz, Die Z,eit als Schicksalsgottheit in der indiscloen and irani- 
schen Religion (1929), pp. i8ff. See also Burgess ( Surya Siddhanta , p. 5), who 
generalizes: “To the Hindus, as to us, Time is, in a metaphorical sense, the great 
destroyer of all things; as such, he is identified with Death, and with Yama, the 
ruler of the dead ”

(4) He surely did bring hither all the beings (worlds), he surely did 
encompass all the beings (worlds). Being their father, he became their 
son; there is, verily, no other force higher than he. 

(5) Time begot yonder heaven, Time also (begot) these earths. That 
which was, and that which shall be, urged forth by Time, spreads out. 

(6) Time created the earth, in Time the sun burns. In Time are all 
beings, in Time the eye looks abroad. . . . 

(8) . . . Time is the lord of everything, he was the father of Prajapati. 

(9) By him this (universe) was urged forth, by him it was begotten, 
and upon him this (universe) was founded. Time, truly, having become 
the brahma (spiritual exaltation), supports Parameshtin (the highest 
lord). 

(10) Time created the creatures (prajah), and Time in the beginning 
(created) the lord of creatures (Prajapati), the self-existing Kashyapa 
and the tapas (creative fervour) from Time were born. 

/ 57.54: (1) From Time the waters did arise, from Time the brahma 
(spiritual exaltation), the tapas (creative fervour), the regions (of space 
did arise). Through Time the sun rises, in Time he goes down again. 

(2) Through Time the wind blows, through Time (exists) the great 
earth; the great sky is fixed in Time. In Time the son (prajapati) begot 
of yore that which was, and that which shall be. 

(3) From Time the Rks (=the Rig Veda) arose, the Yajus {— the 
Yajur Veda) was born from Time; Time put forth the sacrifice, the 
imperishable share of the gods. 

(4) Upon Time the Gandharvas 3 and Apsarases are founded, upon 
Time the worlds (are founded), in Time this Angiras and Atharvan 
rule over the heavens. 

(5) Having conquered this world and the highest world, and the holy 
(pure) worlds (and) their holy divisions; having by means of the 
brahma conquered all the worlds, Time, the highest God, forsooth, 
hastens forward. 

3 See A. Weber ( Die Vedischen Nachrichten iiber die Nakshatras , Pt. 2, p. 278, 
n. 3) about the Gandharvas as representing the days of the “year” of 360 days, 
according to the Bhagavata Parana 4. 29.21 (Sanyal trans., vol. 2, p. 145); the 
Indians reckoned with several types of “years” at the same time, and so did the 
Maya.

W here we alternately read once “beings,” and “worlds,” the San¬ 
skrit word is bhuvana, from the radical bhu- (= Greek phyd-) as dis¬ 
cerned from the radical as-, bhu- meaning “to be” in the sense of per¬ 
petual change, “coming to be and passing away,” as - being reserved for 
the changeless, timeless existence beyond the planetary “instruments of 
time,” the organa chronou of Plato’s Timaeus. As a matter of fact, 
Plato would have understood at once the verbs bhu- and as -, and he 
might well have applauded the utterance of the vanquished Daitya 
KingVali: 4 

“O Indra! Why are you vaunting so much? All persons are prac¬ 
tically urged on by Kala in engaging themselves in an encounter. To 
the heroes, glory, victory, defeat and death gradually come to pass. 
This is the reason that the wise behold this universe as being guided 
by Kala, and they therefore neither grieve nor are elated with joy.” 

Nor is there much “primitive belief” to be squeezed out of such 
statements as “many thousand Indras and other divinities have been 
overtaken by Kala in the course of world periods.” 5 But the classicists 
usually prefer to keep silent about the most revealing sentence of Anaxi¬ 
mander, handed down to us by Cicero (De Natura Deorum 1.25): “It 
is the opinion of Anaximander, that gods are born in long intervals of 
rising and setting, and that they are innumerable worlds (or the —much 
discussed—innumerable worlds. Anaximandri autem opinio est, nativos 
esse deos longis intervallis orientis occidentisque eosque innumerabiles 
esse mundos)”; and if they do not keep silent, they claim it to be 
“much more natural” to understand these intervals as being in space 
than in time (Burnet), by which means every way to understanding is 
effectively blocked. 

This much only for the time being: a broader discussion of Iranian 
Zurvan would wreck our frame; we do not think, however, that Zur- 
van/Chronos represents a “Zoroastrian Dilemma”; to style it thus (with 
Zaehner) is one more mistake: it is not the “beliefs” and “religions” 
which circle around and fight each other restlessly; what changes is the 
celestial situation.

5 Quoted by Eisler, Weltenmantel, p. 501. What the author (pp. 385L) has to say 
about ‘ anthropomorphic, most primitive empathies” (PEinfiihlungen), connected 
with Ouranos, Ge, Helios and Selene, which are, allegedly, miles away from the 
“step of highly abstract conceptions about eternal Time,” is not only a contra- 
dictio in adjecto, but plain thoughtlessness.

The name Mundilfoeri (Mundel-fere) raises a cluster of problems, and 
nothing is gained by evasive statements such as that given by de Vries 
( Altnord . Etym. Wb., p. 395): u Mundilferi. Name of the father of the 
Moon . . . Mundill . Name of a legendary figure.” 

As concerns mund, feminine, it means “hand” (Cleasby-Vigfusson, 
s.v.), but mund comprises the meaning of tutelage, guardianship (cf. 
German Vor mund). Mund as a neutrum means “point of time, mood, 
humor, measure, and the right time” (de Vries, loc. cit.). 




Hamlet’s Mill • 378 


Mi //hi ill (Mundell) is an unknown “legendary figure,” certainly; we 
should he glad to know what the name indicates precisely, but the spe¬ 
cialists do not tell us. There is a small but promising hint: Gering, in his 
commentan on the Edda (vol. /, p. 168), remarked, “The name occurs 
again among the saekommga heiti Sn. E. II, 154.” Heiti are a kind of 
denominations (Ncckcl renders it “Furnamen”) which the skalds used 
side by side with kemiingar (circumlocutions); the list of “heiti of sea- 
kings” is to be found in the Third Grammatical Tract contained in 
Snorri’s Edda (ascribed to Snorri’s nephew Olaf), and among the 
twenty-four heiti, no. 11 is Mysingr, no. 15 is Mimdill. 1 Everyone who 
is familiar with the many names given to the cosmic personae—specific 
names changing according to the order of time—in Babylonian, Indian, 
Chinese, etc., astronomy, is not likely to fall for the idea that these 
heiti w ere names of historical kings. 2 The consequences resulting from 
the understanding of A lysing and Mundill (together with twenty-two 
more heiti) as representatives of the same cosmic function will not be 
worked out in detail here: he who keeps his eye on the different fords, 
ferrymen, pilots, personified divine ships, and kings of the deep sea that 
cross his path in the course of this essay may eventually work out his 
own solution. As for the word fere (in Mundelfere), Gering feels cer¬ 
tain that it is the same word as OHG ferjo , MHG verge , i.e., ferryman, 
the name meaning “ferryman of Mundell.” Gering refers to Finnur 
Johnsson who understood the mund in the name as “time,” and “ex¬ 
plained the name which he took for the name of the moon, originally, 
as ‘den der bewaeger sig efter bestemte tider,’ ” i.e., somebody who 
moves according to definite times, let us say: according to his timetable 
(or schedule). 

There is no reason at all to take Mundilfori for “originally” the name 
of the moon, this luminary not being the only timekeeper at hand. 
Yafthrudnismal 23 says of the Sun and Moon, the childre/i of Mundil- 
fori , that they circle around the sky serving as indicators of time. 3 

“Ferryman of Time” would make a certain sense, but not enough yet 
to enlighten us about Mundill “himself.” The same goes for Sim-

rock’s rather imaginative Mundilfoeri = “Achsenschwinger,” i.e., “axis- 
swinger,” but Simrock has at least thought about a sensible meaning, 
and maybe he has hit the mark quite unbeknownst. Ernst Krause, too, 
racked his brains, modestly asking the experts to examine the relation of 
this mundil with Latin mundus . 4 We do not mean to meddle earnestly 
with this particular question, the less so as mundus translated into “the 
world” has become an empty and insignificant word altogether, but it 
certainly is depressing to watch the progressists working out their latest 
“solutions” for Latin mundus, namely, (i) “ornament,” (2) “jewel¬ 
lery of women,” 5 6 without recalling Greek kosmeo which does mean 
also “to adorn,” to be sure, but not “originally,” and not essentially; 
to establish order, especially in the sense of getting an army into line, 
is what kosmeo means, whence kosmos. And we are not entitled to 
give the silliest of all imaginable meanings to such a central word as 
mundus. 

We should like to approach the words in question by means of the 
common objective significance underlying the vast family of word- 
images engendered by the radical manth , math , whence also (Mount) 
Mandara, mandala, Latin mentula (penis), and also our mondull* which 
is supposed to have replaced the older form mandull. True, mandull/ 
mondull is not yet mundill, and mundus is not identical with mandala, 
yet the whole clan of words depends from a central conception stick¬ 
ing firmly to mtit/mnd, and these consonants connote a swirling, drilling 
motion throughout. We are, here, up to a veritable jungle of misunder¬ 
standings, and the closer we look into the “ars interpretandi” of profes¬ 
sionals, the more impenetrable the jungle becomes. But let us try to 
get a shred of sense by laying bare the more or less “subconscious” 
blunders accomplished by the interpreters dealing with the radical 
manth , the heart and center of the Indian Amrita^/z^/^ana, the “Churn¬ 
ing of Ambrosia,” i.e., the Churning of the Milky Ocean in order to 
gain Amrita/Ambrosia, the drink of immortality. It is some sort of 
case history, the “case” being that manth , math appears to have two 
fundamentally different meanings (and some more), fpr which we

6 Cf. A. Kuhn ( Die Herabkunft des Feuers und des Gottertranks [1886], p. 116) 
where he refers to Aufrecht: “ mondull m., axis rotarum, cotis rotatilis et similium 
instrumentorum”; ibid, note 2, quoting Egilson: “ mondull m. lignum teres, quo mola 
trusatilis circumagitur, mobile, molucrum; mdndidtre m. manubrium ligneum, quo 
mola versatur.” 




Hamlet’s Mill • 380 

quote Macdonell’s Sanskrit dictionary (p. 218): “ manth —a churning, 
killing, mixed beverage (= the Soma mixture); mantha-ka m. churning 
stick; manth-ana, producing fire by attrition.” On page 214 we find 
s.v. math , manth: “whirl around (agnim), rub (a fire stick), churn, 
shake, stir up, agitate, afflict, crush, injure, destroy, . . . mathita bewil¬ 
dered, . . . strike or tear off, . . . uproot, exterminate, kill, destroy, . . . 
strike or tear off, drag away.” 7 

So far, so good. But why insist on such misleading verbs as “striking” 
or “tearing off,” etc.? Did not we hear about Fenja and Menja who 
“ground out a sudden host” for Frodhi, i.e., Mysing? And this is not an 
isolated instance. We know, for instance, of an extremely relevant Hit- 
tite prayer to the Ishtar of Nineveh who is asked “to grind away from 
the enemies their masculinity, power and health” 8 —the Hittites are 
quite respectable members of the Indo-European family of languages. 
Whether something is gained, or something is lost—peace, gold, health, 
heads, virility, and what else—it is ground out, or ground away, when 
the underlying image is a mola trusatilis; it is drilled out, or drilled 
away, when the motion of the cosmos is understood as alternative mo¬ 
tion, as in the case of the Indian churn. We have sufficient reasons to 
take alternative motion for the older conception, but this is irrelevant 
right here and now; relevant is the general conception, expressed by the 
manifold words engendered by the radical manth / math, that every 
event is due to the rotary motion (whether “true” or alternate, com¬ 
pare appendix #17) of the celestial mill or churn, 9 i.e., of the combined 
motions of the planetary spheres and the sphere of fixed stars. 

At the same moment, when we understand mill and churn as the 
celestial machinery, the stumbling stone of “to drill” versus “to rob, to 
destroy” becomes insignificant, and this is important enough, since it 
helps to clear the decent name of the hotly debated Prometheus.

Mannheit, Geschlechtskraft(?) Gesundheit weg; (ihre) Schwerter, Bogen, Pfeile,

9 We touch only slightly the family of Amlodhi’s kvern; it must be enough to 
state that quairnus means “millstone, mill” in Gothic, whereas Old Norse kirna is 
the churn. Jacob Grimm ( Geschichte der dentsche?i Sprache [1848], p. 47) wanted 
to derive quairnus from zarna, zrno, Lith. girna, Latv. dsirnus = corn, kernel, but 
there seems to be no way from there to English churn, and kirna, the Old Norse 
churn. Kuhn (p. 104) calls attention to Sanskrit curna, ground powder, derived in 
the Petersburger Wb. from carv , to crush, to chew.

Adalbert Kuhn, surely a great scholar, has dealt broadly with the 
radical nianth , with Mount Mandara, the churning stick used by the 
Asura and Deva for the churning of the Milky Ocean, and he tried 
hard to bring about a happy marriage between this manthana and Greek 
nianthano “to learn,” confronting us with his rather strange opinion of 
what is “natural.” This is what he says (pp. 15ft.): 

Mit der bisher entwickelten Bedeutung der Wurzel manth hat sich 
aber schon in den Veden die aus dem Verfahren naturlich sich ent- 
wickelnde Vorstellung des Abreissens, Ansichreissens, Raubens ent- 
wickelt und aus dieser ist die Bedeutung des Griech. manthdno 
hervorgegangen, welches demnach als ein an sich reissen, sich aneignen 
des fremden Wissens erscheint. Betrachten wir nun den Namen des 
Prometheus in diesem Zusammenhang, so wird wohl die Annahme, 
dass sich aus dem Feuer entziindenden Rauber der vorbedachtige 
Titane erst auf griechischem Boden entwickelt habe, hinlanglich 
gerechtfertigt erscheinen und zugleich klar werden, dass diese Ab- 
straktion erst aus der sinnlichen Vorstellung des Feuer reibers her¬ 
vorgegangen sein konne. Was die Etymologie des Wortes betrifft, so 
hat auch Pott . . . dasselbe auf manthano in der Bedeutung von mens 
provida , provide?itia zurlickgefuhrt . . . , aber er hatte, sobald er das 
tat, das Sanskritverbum nicht unberucksichtigt lassen sollen . . . Ich 
halte daher an der schon fruher ausgesprochenen Erkliirung fest, nach 
welcher Prometheus aus dem Begriff von pramatha, Raub, hervorge¬ 
gangen ist, so dass es einem vorauszusetzenden Skr. pramathyus, der 
Rauberische, Raub liebende, entspricht, wobei jedoch wohl auch 
jener oben besprochene pramantha—i.e. the upright drilling stick— 
auf die Bildung des Wortes mit eingewirkt hat, zumal Pott auch noch 
einen Zeus Promantheus . . . aus Lycophron 537 nachweist, so dass 
in dem Namen auch der Feueranzundende zugleich mit ausgedruckt 
ware. 

It goes without saying that we do not think it either “natural” or “ob¬ 
vious” to “develop” learning from robbing, or providence from learn¬ 
ing: Prometheus (Lykophron’s Promantheus) -pramantha drilled new 
fire, at a new place, at new crossroads of ecliptic and equator; the 
“gods” did not like that (about which more later). 

Now, pramantha, alias the male fire stick, having the well-known 
naughty connotations, and with the Fecundity-Trust standing around 
the corner, classical philologists fought bitter battles against Kuhn’s 
proposition, for the sake of noble Prometheus who simply should not 
be a fire stick or, worse, the fascinum. The highly emotional classicists 
remained victorious upon the battlefield until very recently, when we 



Hamlet’s Mill • 382 


learn the newest tidings from Mayrhofer, 10 who rules firmly: “ manth , 
‘quirlen’ ist etymologisch von mathmathndti ‘rauben’ (offenbar nasal- 
los) verschieden.” After having dealt with the different meanings of 
the words, already known to us, he continues: “An ausserindischen 
Nachweisen der Vorstufe von ai. math- ‘rauben’ . . . besteht vorerst 
nur die vorsichtig ausgesprochene, aber sehr glaubhafte Zusammenstel- 
lung von ai. pra- math- mit griech. Prometheus, dor. Promatheus 
(Narten) ” 

That is exactly what “progress” means nowadays: that we are offered 
as a brand-new, “cautiously uttered, but very credible connecting of 
Sanskrit pra-math with Greek Prometheus” in 1963, when Kuhn’s sec¬ 
ond edition had been published in 1886. We do not wish to dwell upon 
the claimed “etymological difference” of the radicals manth and math: 
if philologists do not understand a subject, they invent different radi¬ 
cals, which are “mixed” in later times, allegedly, as here math- and 
manth “in post-Vedic times.” 11 

Prometheus was a “pramantha,” as were Quetzalcouatl, Tezcatlipoca, 
the four Agnis, and very many more, drilling or churning with “Mount 
Mandara,” or with Mondull: why not call him Mundilfoeri, the axis- 
swinger? We have, indeed, Altaic stories about one or the other Mun¬ 
dilfoeri “begetting” Sun and Moon. Uno Holmberg states ( Die reli- 
giosen Vorstellungen der altaischen Volker [1938], pp. 22, 63, 8pf.): 

In the myths of the Kalmucks the world mountain—Sumeru, Aleru, 
alias Mandara—appears as the means of creation. The world came 
into being, when four powerful gods got hold of Mount Sumeru, 
and whirled it around in the primordial sea, just as a Kalmuck woman 
turns the churning stick when preparing butter. Out of the vehe¬ 
mently agitated sea came, among others, Sun, Moon, and stars. The 
same significance has, doubtless, the story of the Dorbots, according 
to which once upon a time, before Sun and Moon existed, some being 
began to stir the primordial ocean with a pole of 10,000 furlongs, 
thus bringing forth Sun and Moon. A similar creation is described 
in a Mongolian myth, w here a being coming from heaven—a Lama 
it is supposed to have been, see Holmberg, Finno-Ugric Mythology , 
p. 328—stirs up the primeval sea, until part of the fluid becomes solid.

11 The worst among the relevant cases is the Greek radical lyk, which the experts 
insist upon being two different ones, i.e., lyk = light, and lyk = wolf, without 
spending a thought on Pythagoras, who taught us: “The planets are the dogs of 
Persephone”; all mythical canines have just everything to do with light.

These “creation stories” are more or less deteriorated survivals of the 
Amritamanthana, “the incomparably mighty churn,” in the course of 
which one constellation after the other emerged from the wildly agi¬ 
tated Milky Ocean. 12 And the same goes for the “creation” brought 
forth by the Japanese “parents of the world,” who, standing upon the 
Celestial Bridge, stirred with the celestial jewel-spear the primordial sea 
until parts of it thickened and became islands. The Amritamanthana 
survived also in Greece, in the beginning of Iliad 8, and in the myth of 
Plato’s Statesman, and Plutarch spotted it in Egypt: but this subject 
would make another book. The relevant point was, here, to place 
figures as Mundilfoeri, or some surviving Lama, or Vishnu Cakravartin 
on the cosmological stage, where their modes of “creation” make sense. 

12 The collector of merely funny survivals might enjoy the following yarn from 
Switzerland (Grimm, TA 1 , p. 697): “In the golden age when the brooks and lakes 
were filled with milk, a shepherd was upset in his boat and drowned; his body, 
long sought for, turned up at last in the foamy cream, when they were churning, 
and was buried in a cavity which bees had constructed of honeycombs as large as 
town-gates.”

As concerns the removing of the Pole star, the most drastic version 
is told by the Lapps: 

When Arcturus (alpha Bootis, supposed to be an archer, Ursa Major 
being his bow) shoots down the North Nail with his arrow on the 
last day, the heaven will fall, crushing the earth and setting fire to 
everything. 1 

Other legends prefer to deal with the fate of circumpolar stars, the 
result being the same. 

The Siberian Kirghis call the three stars of the Little Bear nearest the 
Pole star, which form an arch, a “rope” to which the two larger stars 
of the same constellation, the two horses, are fastened. One of the 
horses is white, the other bluish-grey. The seven stars of the Great 
Bear they call the seven watchmen, whose duty it is to guard the 
horses from the lurking wolf. When once the wolf succeeds in killing

the horses the end of the w orld will come. I11 other tales the stars of 
the Great Hear are “seven wolves” who pursue those horses. Just 
before the end of the world they will succeed in catching them. Some 
even fancy that the Great Bear is also tied to the Pole Star. When 
once all the bonds are broken there will be a great disturbance in the 
sky. 2 

According to South Russian folklore, a dog is fettered to Ursa Minor, 
and tries constantly to bite through the fetter; wffien he succeeds, the 
end of the world has come. 

Others say that Ursa Major consists of a team of horses with harness; 
every night a black dog is gnawing at the harness, in order to destroy 
the w orld, but he does not reach his aim; at daw T n, w hen he runs to 
a spring to drink, the harness renews itself. 3 

A very strange and apparently stone-old story is told by the Skidi- 
Pawnee about the end and the beginning of the w r orld. 4 

Various portents will precede: the moon will turn red and the sun 
will die in the skies. The North Star is the powder which is to preside 
at the end of all things, as the Bright Star of Evening w T as the ruler 
when life began. The Morning Star, the messenger of heaven, w hich 
revealed the mysteries of fate to the people, said that in the beginning, 
at the first great council wTich apportioned to star folk their stations, 
tw T o of the people fell ill. One of these w r as old, and one w T as young. 
They w T ere placed upon stretchers, carried by stars (Ursa Major and 
Ursa Minor), 5 and the two stretchers w T ere tied to the North Star.

and higher in the heavens, and nearer and nearer to the North Star, 
and w T hen the time for the end of life draw r s nigh, the Death Star will

5 The Sioux take Ursa Major for a coffin, accompanied by mourners. This pic¬ 
ture is not too “obvious,” so it is significant that Ursa is banat na'sh with the 
Arabs, i.e., the bier and its daughters; the bier is formed by the chest of the wagon, 
El-na’sh, the handle of the Dipper being the daughters. See Ideler, Sternnamen , 
pp. 19b Kunitzsch, Arabische Sternnamen in Europa , p. 149, no. 71, adds that, 
according to Athanasius Kircher, christianized Arabs recognized in the constella¬ 
tion the coffin of Lazarus, followed by the mourners Maryam, Marta, and their 
maid (al-ama). See also Henninger, ZfE 75), p. 81. Due to Islamic influence, the 
constellation is called bintang al'nash , star of the bier, by the people of Minangka- 
bau, Southern Sumatra. (See H. Werner, “Die Verstirnung des Osiris-Mythos,”

approach so close to the North Star that it will capture the stars that 
bear the stretchers and cause the death of the persons who are lying 
ill upon those stellar couches. The North Star will then disappear and 
move away and the South Star will take possession of earth and its 
people. The command for the ending of all things will be given by 
the North Star, and the South Star will carry out the commands. Our 
people were made by the stars. When the time comes for all things 
to end our people will turn into small stars and will fly to the South 
Star where they belong/' 

To return to better known provinces, Proclus informs us that the 
fox star nibbles continuously at the thong of the yoke which holds to¬ 
gether heaven and earth; German folklore adds that when the fox 
succeeds, the world will come to its end. 6 This fox star is no other than 
Alcor, 7 the small star g near zeta Ursae Majoris (in India Arundati, the 
common wife of the Seven Rishis, alpha-eta Ursae; see p. 301 about 
Arundati and Elamitic Narundi, sister of the Sibitti, the “Seven*'), 
known as such since Babylonian times. 8 

The same star crosses our way again in the Scholia to Aratus 9 where 
we are told that it is Electra. mother of Dardanus, who left her station 
among the Pleiades, desperate because of Ilion's fall, and retired “above 
the second star of the beam . . . others call this star ‘fox/ ” 

This small piece of evidence may show the reader two things: (1) 
that the Fall of Troy meant the end of a veritable world-age. (For the 
time being, we assume that the end of the Pleiadic age is meant; 
among various reasons, because Dardanos came to Troy after the third 
flood, according to Nonnos.); (2) that Ursa Major and the Pleiades 
figuring on the shield of Achilles, destroyer of Troy, have a precise 
significance, and are not to be taken as testimony for the stupendous 
ignorance of Homer who knew none but these constellations, as the

specialists want us to believe. There are, indeed, too many traditions 
connecting Ursa and the Pleiades with this or that kind of catastrophe 
to be overlooked. Among the many we mention only one example from 
later Jewish legends, some lines taken out of a most fanciful description 
of Noah’s flood, quoted by Frazer: 10 

Now the deluge was caused by the male waters from the sky meeting 
the female waters which issued forth from the ground. The holes in 
the sky by which the upper waters escaped were made by God when 
he removed stars out of the constellation of the Pleiades; and in order 
to stop this torrent of rain, God had afterwards to bung up the two 
holes with a couple of stars borrowed from the constellation of the 
Bear. That is why the Bear runs after the Pleiades to this day; she 
wants her children back, but she will never get them till after the 
Last Day.

without saying, mythic measures are time measures, generally, but this 
fact is so seldom recognized that this white raven has to be welcomed 
enthusiastically. The “localization under the earth” points to the (in¬ 
visible) South of the world, as will come out later. By which we do not 
mean to say we understood the enigmatical picture of this measuring 
tree. 

Now, Heimdal and Loke, perpetual enemies as they are, kill each 
other at Ragnarok, but Heimdal’s death is accomplished by means of 
a very strange weapon, i.e., by a “head.” Snorri’s Skaldskaparmal 8 (see 
also 69) offers an ambiguous kenning: “Heimdal’s head is the sword, 
or, the sword is Heimdal’s head,” 3 or we learn that the sword was 
called “miotudr Heimdaler,” and that is, according to Jacob Grimm, 4 
“the measurer (sector, messor).” Thus, Heimdal measures—or is he 
measured?—by means of a sword that is also said to be his very own 
head. Strange goings-on, indeed. Ohlmarks 5 declared the sword to be 
the Sun—a pleasant change for once, otherwise everything and every¬ 
body is the Moon, with him—but although the measuring instrument, 
whether the “golden rope” or not,, usually is the sun (see p. 154 on Va- 
runa, and p. 246 on Theaethetus 153c [the latter is by Plato]), we have 
the suspicion that the case of Heimdal’s head/sword is more compli¬ 
cated, and that it may not be settled until we know much more about 
Loke.

To prevent rash critics from hurling into our faces the—maybe they 
will style it thus—“complete absence of technological knowledge,” we 
hasten to assert that the relevant inquiries are not as foreign to us as 
they might assume. 1 Curwen might point to his enlightened sentence: 

1 To mention only a few useful titles: Joseph Needham, Science and Civilisation 
in China , vol. 4, Pt. II, (1965); Gordon Childe’s chapter on “Rotary Motion,” in

\Vc are, happily, emerging from that state of blissful ignorance of the 
subject which made possible such an anachronism as Decamps’ well- 
known picture of “Samson grinding in the Prison-house,” wherein 
Samson is seen turning a huge mill-stone by means of a long lever 
like a capstan-bar, after the fashion of the Roman slaves a thousand 
years later. * 2 

There arc, indeed, “a number of reasons for questioning the common 
belief that grainmills were rotary,” as Moritz states (p. 53). And 
whereas Forbes (Studies in Ancient Technology, vol. 3, p. 155, n. 3) 
votes for “rotary querns ... in Assyrian times,” Lynn White (p. 108) 
says: “But while continuous rotary motion was used in this large mola 
versatilis and, of course, in the water mill which appears in the first 
century b.c., it is by no means clear how early such a motion was used 
with querns,” which is certainly true. That true rotary motion was 
used with the potter’s wheel much earlier is unquestionable, which is 
the more relevant, as the potter’s wheel, too, belongs to the cosmological 
instrumentation, e.g., in the hands of Ptah and Khnum. Decisive is the 
Ancient Egyptian instrument for drilling out stone vessels, which was 
perhaps even cranked, but there is no unanimity among the historians 
of technology as to the real nature of this device. In this case and in 
that of the mill, the accent goes with “true” rotary motion, because 
there are two kinds of rotary motion, to which we quote Gordon 
Childe (Singer, p. 187) on the difference “between continuous, true and 
complete rotary motion, and partial or discontinuous rotary motion. 
For true rotary motion, the revolving part of the instrument must be 
free to turn in the same direction indefinitely . There are, however, a 
number of processes which involve a partial turn of the instrument, such 
as boring and drilling by hand. There are even machines like the bow- 
drill or the pole-lather which allow a number, but only a limited num¬ 
ber, of complete revolutions of the revolving part. Partial rotary motion 
of this sort has been used by man much longer than true rotary motion.” 

Now, we do not wish to suppress White’s footnote (p. 109), where 
he claims Fenja’s and Menja’s Grotte to have been an apparatus involv¬ 
ing alternative motion, “no doubt.” This might be the case, although we

understatement!

do not agree with the “no doubt”: several doubts are permitted. We 
shall abstain, however, from discussing this and similar questions as long 
as we do not understand precisely and thoroughly how the “Churning 
of the Milky Ocean” was thought to work, in India, and in Egypt, 
where the specialists insist upon calling the celestial churn a “symbol of 
uniting the two lands,” and in the survivals in Homer and Plato. For the 
time being we do think that the oldest technological device used in 
cosmological terminology was, indeed, a churn or a drill, implicating 
alternative motion. 

The point is this: whether or not Samson, or Fenja and Menja, waited 
on an oscillating quern or on a true rotary mill is a cosmological ques¬ 
tion, and will hardly be decided by historians of technology. To illus¬ 
trate this, we have a look at that “mill” of the Cherokee Indians, men¬ 
tioned in the chapter on the Galaxy, where it is told that “people in the 
South had a corn mill,” from which meal was stolen again and again; 
the owners discovered the thief, a dog, who “ran off howling to his 
home in the North, with the meal dropping from his mouth as he ran, 
and leaving behind a white trail where now we see the Milky Way, 
which the Cherokee call to this day . . . ‘Where the dog ran.’ ” In his 
supplementary notes (p. 443), Afooney explains: “In the original ver¬ 
sion the mill was probably a wooden mortar, such as was commonly 
used by the Cherokee . . Well, in the “original version,” as told by 
the Cherokee , we may rely on their talking of a mortar—but certainly 
not in the truly “original” myth. There is no possible way whatsoever 
of “developing” out of “primitive” mortars (or grindstones) cosmologi¬ 
cal imagery; in other words: the Cherokee mortar is a “deteriorated” 
mill (whether oscillating or not). 

The cosmic machine (mill, drill, or churn) produces periods of time, 
it brings about the “separation of heaven and earth,” etc. Along the wav 
of diffusion into unfamiliar surroundings, particularly tropical ones 
(lacking grain, plow culture, etc.), the Mill (or churn) ceases to be 
understood, while the memory sticks to an instrument for crushing 
foodstuff. And, suddenly, we are told in several continents how Heaven, 
who once was lying closely upon Earth, withdrew in anger because 
of women who, busy with their mortars, kept bumping with their 
pestles against Heaven’s body. An extremely pointless idea, the origin 
of which is only to be understood when we follow it back to the highly 
complicated machinery which stood at its beginning (historically as 
well as “sinngemass”), and begot quite innocently such strange off¬ 
shoots. 




I Iamlet’s Mill • 390 


Although \vc do not like to apply strictly scientific models to his¬ 
torical phenomena, here we abuse the case of entropy: to derive Grotte 
(the Amritamanthana, etc.) from those utterly nonsensical females 
bumping their pestles against “Heaven” would be on the same level as 
to derive the original substances from the state of randomly mingled 
gases. 

These minima only for the technological problem. We keep these 
questions under lock and key on purpose, and not because it has not 
dawned upon us that the technological aspect is a very important one. 
On the contrary, we nurse the suspicion that next to nobody has an 
idea of the huge difficulties that arise with churn, mill, and fire drill, if 
one understands them properly as machines which were meant to de¬ 
scribe the motions of nested spheres.

Appendix ip 

A remarkable amount of information about submarine creatures is 
contained in Mansikka’s inquiry into Russian magic formulae, already 
mentioned; 1 intermingled as the material is with the author’s rather vio¬ 
lent “interpretatio Christiana,” it is well-nigh impossible to lay one’s 
hands on the bare facts. This much can be said, however: in the middle 
of the “Blue Sea” (or “the middle of the whole earth”), there is either 
(a) an island—most of the time called Bujan, from the same radical as 
buoy—“the center of celestial power,” upon which there is a tree, or 
a stone, or a tree upon a stone, sometimes the cross or the “mountain 
of Zion” itself; 2 or there is (b) the “White Altar-Stone,” which is a 
“fiery” one, lying in the navel of the sea without being supported by 
an island; under this stone, there is “a green fire, the king of all fires,” 
or an “eternal, unquenchable fire” that “has to be procured from under 
the stone” (Mansikka, p. 188—we are not told for what purpose the 
fire has to be fetched from there; the text says only “for burning”). 
Sometimes it is said that upon this stone—regardless of its being “holy” 
and the “Stone of the Altar,” and even “Christ’s Throne”—was the 
“habitation of the Devil himself”; 3 in other formulae the point is stressed 
that this fire “scorches and burns the decayed and impure power of 
the devil” (i.e., “die verfallene, unreine Macht des Teufels,” where “ver- 
fallen” may mean either “decayed” or “forfeited”). As long as this 
unquenchable fire remains safely under a stone, nothing dangerous is 
going to happen; accordingly, a German formula (Mansikka, p. 37) 
says: “In Christ’s Garden there is a well, in the well there is a stone, 
under the stone lies a golden snake.” That snake can also be a scorpion, 
as we have just seen (footnote 3). 

1 Vber russische Zauberformeln (1909), pp. 168-213: “The Sea, the Stone, the 
Virgin Mary.” 

2 Thus it is said that “upon the mountains of Zion, upon the white stone stands 
the pillar and the altar of Christ,” or, “a pillar from the earth to heaven.” In a 
prayer Christ is addressed: “O, thou deadly stone pillar” (o, du todliche Steinsaule, 
Mansikka, p. 187). 

3 Mansikka, p. 189; see also the formula on pp. 35b: “Es gibt ein heiliges 
Meer Ozean, in seiner Mitte liegt ein weisser stein, aus dem weissen Stein kommt 
eine grimmige Schlange, der Skorpion, hervor ... In dem teuflischen Sumpf liegt 
der weisse Stein Latyr; auf dem weissen Stein Latyr aber sitzt der leibhaftige 
Teufel.”

The Mordvinians 4 have a long story to tell about God, Tsham-Pas, 
who was rocking to and fro upon a stone in the primordial sea, thinking 
deeply about how to create the world and how to rule it afterward, and 
complaining: “1 have neither a brother nor a companion with whom to 
discuss the matter.” Angrily he spat into the sea, the spittle turned into 
a large mountain from which emerged Saitan and offered himself as part¬ 
ner in the discussion. Tsham-Pas sent his new companion to the bottom 
of the sea to fetch sand, admonishing him to mention his (God’s) name 
before touching the sand. Saitan did not do so, and was burned heavily 
by the flames which came out of the bottom of the sea; this happened 
twice, and Tsham-Pas warned Saitan that, should he not mention the 
divine name when diving for the third time, the flames would consume 
him completely. The bad companion obeyed and brought, finally, the 
sand necessary for the creation. But since he could not abstain from 
playing tricks, God chased him away, saying: “Go away to the bottom 
of the sea, to the other world, in that fire that burned you when you 
were too proud to mention the name of your creator. Sit there and 
suffer for all eternity.” 

In India, where the word “eternity” is not applied as thoughtlessly 
as in European legends, the Harivamsa tells us the following about the 
offspring of the sage Aurva (i.e., “born from the thigh,” mu), as we 
hear from Dowson: 5 6 

The sage was urged by his friends to beget children. He consented, 
but he foretold that his progeny would live by destruction of others. 
Then he produced from his thigh a devouring fire, which cried out 
with a loud voice, ‘I am hungry; let me consume the world.’ The 
various regions were soon in flames, when Brahma interfered to save 
his creation, and promised the son of Aurva a suitable abode and 
maintenance. The abode was to be at Badava-mukha, the mouth of 
the ocean; for Brahma was born and rests in the ocean, and he and the 
newly produced fire were to consume the world together at the end 
of each age, and at the end of time to devour all things with the gods, 
Asuras, and Rakshasas. The name Aurva thus signifies, shortly, the 
submarine fire. It is also called Badavanala and Samvarttaka. It is 
represented as a flame with a horse’s head, and it is also called Kaka- 
dhwaya, from carrying a banner on which there is a crow. 

In the Alahabharataf this story is told by the Rishi Vasishtha (zeta 
Ursae Alajoris) in order to appease his grandson, who likewise wished

to destroy the whole world without delay: “Then, o child, Aurva cast 
the fire of his wrath into the abode of Varuna. 7 And that fire which 
consumeth the waters of the great Ocean, became like unto a large 
horse’s head which persons conversant with the Vedas call by the name 
of Vadavamukha. And emitting itself from that mouth it consumeth 
the waters of the mighty ocean.” 

This fiery horse’s head guides the curious straight into the mazes of 
the Mahabharata and the Shatapatha Brahmana where they are most im¬ 
penetrable because they deal with the enigmatic story of the Rishi 
Dadhyank, whose horse’s head was dwelling in Lake Saryanavant, after 
it had revealed the “secret of madhu” (madhuvidya; madhu — honey 
mead) to the Ashvins, the Dioscures, 8 and out of whose bones (the 
bones of the horse’s skull) Tvashtri forged the thunderbolt for Indra, 
thus enabling him to slay “the 99 vritras” 9 —as Samson killed the Philis¬ 
tines with the jaw-bone of an ass—whereas Vishnu used this head to 
reconquer the Vedas that had been carried away by two Daityas during 
one of those time-swallowing “Yoga-sleeps” of Vishnu. Bereft of the 
Vedas , Brahma, to whom they served as “eyes,” was unable to continue 
the work of creation, so that he implored the Lord of the universe to 
awake. “Praised by Brahma, the illustrious Purusha . . . shook off his 
slumber, resolved to recover the Vedas (from the Daityas that had 
forcibly snatched them away). Applying his Yoga-puissance, he as¬ 
sumed a second form . . . He assumed an equine head of great efful¬ 
gence, which was the abode of the Vedas. The firmament, with all its 
luminaries and constellations, became the crown of his head . . . Having 
assumed this form endued with the equine head . . . the Lord of the 
universe disappeared then and there, and proceeded to the nether 
regions” 10 —to return with the Vedas , successfully, and resuming his 
sleep, as goes without saying. 

In other words, the “equine head” is as important a “form” of Vishnu 
as an enigmatical one, so much so, in fact, that the more “popular” tra¬ 
dition seems to ignore it, although the Great Epic tells us the following:

In days of \ore, for doing good to the world, Narayana [Vishnu] 
took birth as the great Rishi Vadavamukha [see above, Aurva’s son, 
the mouth of the ocean, Vadavamukha]. While engaged in practising 
severe austerities on the breast of Aleru, he summoned the Ocean to 
his presence. The Ocean, however, disobeyed his summons [Greek 
Ok can os, too, was in the habit not to make his appearance, when Zeus 
summoned everybody to assemble.] Incensed at this, the Rishi, with 
the heat of his body, caused the waters of the Ocean to become as 
saltish in taste as the human sweat. The Rishi further said, ‘Thy 
water shall henceforth cease to be drinkable. Only when the Equine- 
head, roving within thee, will drink thy waters, they will be as sweet 
as honey.’—It is for this curse that the waters of the Ocean to this 
day arc saltish to the taste and are drunk by no one else than the 
Equine head. 11 

The translator, Pratap Chandra Roy, remarks in a footnote (p. 583), 
without referring to the first book of the epic: 

The Hindu scriptures mention that there is an Equine-head of vast 
proportions which roves through the seas. Blazing fires constantly 
issue from its mouth and these drink up the sea-water. It always makes 
a roaring noise. It is called Vadava-mukha. The fire issuing from it 
is called Vadava-nala. The waters of the Ocean are like clarified but¬ 
ter. The Equine-head drinks them up as the sacrificial fire drinks 
the libations of clarified butter poured upon it. The origin of the 
Vadava fire is sometimes ascribed to the wrath of Urva, a Rishi of 
the race of Jamadagni. Hence it is sometimes called Aurvya-fire. 

None of the authorities quoted hitherto thought it worth mentioning 
where this Vadava-mukha was supposed to be. Only when checking the 
word in Macdonell’s Practical Sanskrit Dictionary (p. 267) did we learn 
—exactly as foreseen, although Macdonell means a terrestrial South 
Pole, presumably—that “vadaba, f. = mare; Vivasvat’s wife, who in 
the form of a mare became the mother of the Ashvins . . . vadaba-agni, 
m. submarine fire (supposed to be situated at the south pole) . . . 
vadaba-mukha, n. mare’s mouth = entrance of hell at the south pole.” 

We are not likely to change these dark plots into a lucid and coherent 
story by dealing, here and now, more closely with Dadhyank, whose 
name is said to mean “milk-curdling,” and who is a “producer of Agni,” 
and by comparing the several characters who are accused of swallowing 
up the ocean: we only hope to guide the attention to one among the 
many unperceived concrete problems.

We might be suspected of proposing to identify the sea-swallowing 
horse’s head w ith the equally thirsty Agastya-Canopus, 12 just to simplify 
the situation, and there are factors which invite such a “solution.” 13 But 
the horse is the animal of Mars, and it is “the khshatriya Apam Napat 
with the swift horses” who “seizes the hvarnah,” hiding it in the “bot¬ 
tom of the deep sea, the bottom of the deep lake”: 14 the “nephew” 
(napat) of the waters (apam), and not the original (and highest) ruler 
of the “mouth of the ocean,” alias pi narati, “the confluence of the 
rivers,” i.e., Canopus, which the Tahitians of old called “Festivity-from- 
whence-comes-the-flux-of-the-sea” (T. Henry, Ancient Tahiti [1928 ], 
p. 363). Aurva’s frightening son is, moreover, a “newly produced fire,” 
as we have heard, and Apam Napat is by no means the one and only 
“Agni”; the Rigveda knows of four “fires,” Agnis, allegedly consumed 
by the sacrificial service, one after the other. No valid insight is likely 
to be gained before we cease to disregard the only mythical dimension 
that counts: time. 

Horses’ heads not being connected with deep waters quite “natu¬ 
rally,” we might close with some stories collected by Jacob Grimm 
(TAd, pp. 597T) which go to show that 

Lakes cannot endure to have their depth gauged. On the Mummelsee , 
when the sounders had let down all the cord out of nine nets with a 
plummet without finding a bottom, suddenly the raft began to sink, 
and they had to seek safety in a rapid flight to land ... A man went 
in a boat to the middle of the Titisee, and payed out no end of line 
after the plummet, when there came out of the waves a terrible cry: 
“Measure me, and I’ll eat you up!” In a great fright the man desisted 
from his enterprise, and since then no one has dared to sound the

of Polynesian Astronomy (1941), p. 157, for a summary. There, the heavenly 
waters of Rangi-tamaku (i.e., the sky which lies directly above the visible one) be¬ 
came overheated and evaporated, so that whole tribes of celestial fish had to emi¬ 
grate by descending on the “Road of the Spider,” where they met Tawhaki 
ascending on his expedition to avenge his father.

depth of the lake . . . There is a similar story . . . about Huntsoe, that 
some people tried to fathom its depth with a ploughshare tied to the 
line, and from below came the sound of a spirit-voice: “i maale vore 
vagge, vi ska I maale jeres lagge!” Full of terror they hauled up the 
line, but instead of the share found an old horse’s skull fastened to it. 


Appendix 20 


Such stories are no jokes, although they make this impression when 
they cross our way in Eurasian folklore. “Air” is a strictly astronomical 
and, therefore, also a “religious” term. Thus, we hear from Rabbi 
Eleazar b. Pedath (ca. a.d. 270): “Als der Pharaoh aus Agypten auszog, 
die Israeliten zu verfolgen, erhoben sie ihre Augen gen Himmel und 
sahen den Engelsfiirsten Agyptens in der Luft fliegen.” 

“That signifies the fall of Egypt,” adds Bertholet, who mentions this 
case in his article on the “guardian angel of Persia” (Festschrift Pavry, 
p. 38), starting from Isa. xxiv.21 and its rabbinical interpretations. He 
also points to the utterance of Rabbi Chanina (ca. a.d. 225): “Nicht 
bestraft Gott eine Nation eher, als bis er zuvor ihren Engelfiirsten im 
Himmel bestraft hat,” to which he compares Ps. xxiv.21: “On that day 
the Lord will punish the host of heaven, in heaven, and the kings of the 
earth, on the earth.” 

These “guardian angels” will be identified sooner or later, insofar as 
this has not yet been accomplished in older literature which our con¬ 
temporaries disdain as “obsolete”; one among them, the “angel-lord” of 
Esau/Edom, with whom, according to the Zohar, Jacob wrestled (Gen. 
xxxii. 24-33), is the planet Mars. 1 How the whole system really works— 
e.g., these punishments first in “heaven,” subsequently “on earth”—will 
not be understood before Plato’s Tinmens is taken as earnestly as it was 
taken by the Pythagorean Timaios himself, whom Plato introduced as 

1 See J. Eisenmenger, Entdecktes Jzidenthimi i (1711), pp. 844-46; cf. The Zohar , 
144a, 146a (trans. by H. Sperling and M. Simon, [1956], vol. 2, pp. 63, 70L): “For 
Jacob conquered the serpent with prudence and craft, but chiefly by means of the 
he-goat; and although the serpent and Sammael are the same, yet he also conquered 
Sammael by another method, as described in the passage, saying: and there wrestled 
a man with him until the breaking of the day (Gen. xxxii.25-26).” And: “Another 
blessing he [Jacob] received from that angel, the chieftain of Esau.” A. Jeremias 
(ATAO, p. 324) maintains that the wrestling took place at “Nibiru,” which he 
identifies, here, with the solstice, but see appendix #39. For angels as stars, see also 
M. Knapp, Antiskia (1927), pp. 33-36.

further. (See below, chapter XXII, for a superficial touching on this 
cosmic system.) 


Appendix 21 


A faint, though rather pleasant, echo of such huge events, comes from 

an Esthonian story about the Lake Eim changing his bed (Grimm, 
TM, p. 599 ): 

On his banks lived wild and wicked men, who never mowed the 
meadows that he watered, nor sowed the fields he fertilized, but 
robbed and murdered, so that his bright wave was befouled with the 
blood of the slain. And the lake mourned; and one evening he called 
his fish together, and mounted with them into the air. The brigands 
hearing a din cried: “The Eim has left his bed, let us collect his fish 
and hidden treasure.” But the fish were gone, and nothing was found 
at the bottom but snakes, toads and salamanders, which came creep¬ 
ing out and lodged with the ruffian brood. 

But the Eim rose higher and higher, and swept like a white cloud 
through the air; said the hunters in the woods: “What is this murky 
weather passing over us?” and the herdsmen: “What white swan is 
flying in the sky?” All night he hung among the stars, at morn the 
reapers spied him, how that he was sinking, and the white swan be¬ 
came as a white ship, and the ship as a dark drifting cloud. And out 
of the waters came a voice: “Get thee hence with thy harvest, I come 
to dwell with thee.” Then they bade him welcome, if he would 
bedew their fields and meadows, and he sank down and stretched 
himself in his new couch. They set his bed in order, built dikes, and 
planted young trees around to cool his face. Their fields he made 
fertile, their meadows green; and they danced around him, so that 
old men grew young for joy. 

In a note, Grimm quotes F. Thiersch's opinion on this lake: 

Must not Eim be the same as Embach (mother-beck, fr. emma 
mother . . . ) near Dorpat, whose origin is reported as follows? When 
God had created heaven and earth, he wished to bestow on the beasts 
a king, to keep them in order, and commanded them to dig for his 
reception a deep broad beck, on whose banks he might walk; the 
earth dug out of it was to make a hill for the king to live on. All the 
beasts set to work, the hare measured the land, the fox's brush tailing

•after him marked the course of the stream; when they had finished 
hollowing out the bed, God poured water into it out of his golden 
bowl. 

1 low tough the life of tradition is! And how obvious—here, we mean 
it—that more is meant than the changing of the bed of a river or a lake; 
that rivers have their own method of establishing a new course, instead 
of flying, fish included, in the air and hanging among stars, is a fact that, 
we trust, was not unknown to our ancestors, whether Esthonians or not. 


Appendix 22 


A survival, vague as it is, and evidently mistaking a chariot for a wain, 
we find in India. The Surya-Siddhanta states: “In Taurus, the 17th 
degree, a planet of which the latitude is a little more than two degrees, 
south, will split the njoain of Rohini” 1 

According to Burgess (p. 214), Rohini’s (— Aldebaran) wain “con¬ 
tains five stars, in the grouping of which Hindu fancy has seen the fig¬ 
ure of a wain,” i.e., the Hyades, containing epsilon, delta, gamma, nu, 
alpha Tauri. Burgess continues (p. 249): “The Siddhanta does not in¬ 
form us what would be the consequences of such an occurrence; that 
belongs rather to the domain of astrology than of astronomy. We cite 
from the Pancatantra (vv. 238-241) the following description of these 
consequences, derived from the astrological writings of Varahamihira: 

‘When Saturn splits the wain of Rohini here in the world, the 
Madhava rains not upon the earth for 12 years. 

When the wain of Prajapati’s asterism is split, the earth, having as 
it were committed a sin, performs, in a manner, her surface being 
strewn with ashes and bones, the Kapalika penance. 

If Saturn, Mars, or the descending node splits the wain of Rohini, 
why need I say that, in a sea of misfortune, destruction befalls the 
world? 

When the moon is stationed in the midst of Rohini’s wain, the men 
wander recklessly about, deprived of shelter, eating the cooked flesh 
of children, drinking water from vessels burnt by the sun.’ 

By what conception this curious feature of the ancient Hindu astrol¬ 
ogy is founded, we are entirely ignorant.”

The bad experiences which Saturn had with Auriga’s vehicle— 
whether beta zeta Tauri, or the Hyades—seem to have left a trace in 
the memory of Indian astrologers. 


Appendix 23 


See J. Kepler, “De Stella Nova in Pede Serpentarii et qui sub ejus 
exortum de novo iniit Trigono Igneo,” in Opera Omnia , ed. C. Frisch 
(1859), vol. 2 , p. 636. See also J. Kepler, “De vero anno quo Aeternus 
Dei Filius humanam naturam . . . assumsit,” in Opera Omnia (1863), 
vol. 4, pp. 346ff. 

Kepler was less interested in the revolution of one angle of the trigon 
through the whole zodiac than in the span of time which the conjunc¬ 
tions needed to pass through all four “elements,” particularly between 
conjunctions in the “fiery triplicity.” The zodiac is divided into four 
“elementary” trigons or triplicities in the following manner: 

Fire: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius 

Earth: Taurus, Virgo, Capricornus 
Air: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius 

Water: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces 

The “great conjunction” of Saturn and Jupiter, occurring every 
twenty years, remains about 200 years within one triplicity; it moves 
through all four “elements” in 800 years (more exactly: in 794/3 years). 
By means of the average of 800 years which it took the conjunction to 
pass from one “fiery triplicity” to the other, Kepler reconstructed 
history:

As concerns the—faraway—2400 a.d., Kepler remarks: “Ubi tunc 
nos ct modo florentissima nostra Germania? Et quinam successores nostri? 
An ct memorcs nostri erunt? Siquidem mundus duraverit.” (“Floren¬ 
tissima Germania”: this was written before the Thirty Years’ War 
started.) 

Compare 11 . I I. Kritzinger ( Der Stern der Weisen [ 1911 ], pp. 35, 44, 
59), who deals broadly with the significance of “great conjunctions,” 
and who adds: “The same table was repeated, with more precise data, 
by Riccioli in his Almagestum Novnm (Tom. 1, 672-75), beginning 
with the verses: 

Ignea Triplicitas, coniunctio Maxima dicta 
Saturniq. Jouisque, annis redit Octingentis.” 

What is called here “great conjunction”—occurring every twenty 
years—has been styled in earlier times, i.e., in Sasanian and Arabian 
astrology, “small conjunction,” as we learn from E. S. Kennedy: 1 

After about 12 such small conjunctions the next conjunction will pull 
forward into the next triplicity. This event, called the shift or transit 
(intiqal al-mamarr) is also known as the middle conjunction . . . Four 
middle conjunctions carry the phenomenon through all the triplicities 
and make up a big conjunction . But in order that the entire cycle 
recommence from a particular initial sign, taken as Capricorn, three 
big conjunctions are required, these making up a mighty conjunction. 

A “mighty conjunction” thus corresponds to the revolution of one 
angle or corner of the trigon of Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions—built up 
in sixty years (more correctly: 59.6 years)—through the whole zodiac, 
completed in 2400 years (2383 years, respectively). 

For one particular reason why the “big conjunction” of 800 years 
should be multiplied by 3, see Oscar Marcel Hinze’s article: 2 within the 
frame of archaic “Gestalt-Astronomie,” it was the revolution of the 
trigon as a whole that “counted.” (Hinze deals also with the hexagon, 
i.e., the “Gestalt” of Mercury—revolution of one corner about twenty 
years—and with the famous “Pentagramma Veneris.”) 

As concerns the role of Saturn-Jupiter conjunctions in Iran and India, 
cf. also D. Pingree (“Astronomy and Astrology in India and Iran,”

trine of ‘Transit’ (Mamarr),” JAOS 7 8 (1958)^. 259.

ISIS J-/ [1963], p. 244), and the forthcoming paper by B. L. van der 
Waerden on “the conjunction of 3102 b.c.”— this very conjunction 
introduces the flood of the Mahabharata . Allegedly, there is no trace of 
big conjunctions in Hindu and Hellenistic astrology. Astrology, how¬ 
ever, is not found in texts only which are recognizable as such at first 
glance. Apart from Greece, where we have—besides the wrestling of 
Kronos and Saturn at Olympia—also the Daidalia , held in the interval 
of sixty years—sixty-year cycles in India, or in the West Sudan, are not 
likely to be understood, if the scholars prefer to inhibit the trigon of 
the Saturn-Jupiter conjunction; this inhibition being the logical out¬ 
come of the persistent refusal to recognize Saturn and Jupiter as Saturn 
and Jupiter. 

The decisive conjunction of 6 b.c. (that “opened'’ our age of Pisces) 
having been near zeta Piscium, it is slightly surprising to learn from 
Burgess (Surya-Siddbanta, p. 14) the following—he explains the Indian 
notion of nutation (also called libration): “The vernal equinox librates 
westwards and eastwards from the fixed point, near zeta Piscium, as¬ 
sumed as the commencement of the sidereal sphere,'’ the “libration" 
moving in eastern and western directions for twenty-seven degrees from 
this fixed point. On p. 230 he states about zeta Piscium that “it coin¬ 
cided in longitude with the vernal equinox in the year 572 of our era.”

Eduard Stucken ( Astralmythen , pp. iqoflF.) and, later, F. W. Albright 
(JAOS 40, pp. 3 29f.) drew attention to the very same method em¬ 
ployed when Rishyasringa, son of Yibhandaka (son of Kashyapa) and 
a hind, was lured by a courtesan, ordered by King Lomapada, into the 
latter’s town, because only with Rishyasringa present would the coun¬ 
try have rain. (Compare H. Liiders, “Die Sage von Rsvasrnga,” in 
Philologica lndica [1940], pp. 1-42; also Liiders, “Zur Sage von 
Rsvasrnga,’' Philologica lndica , pp. 43-73.) 

The major difference between GE and the story told in the Mahab¬ 
harata 5.110-13 (R°y trans., vol. 2 , pp. 242-48) is that Father Yibhan¬ 
daka is the one “whose body was covered with hair down to the tip of 
the nails . . . and whose life was pure and was passed in religious medita-

tion”; seduced is the son, not a hairy one, apparently, but “there was a 
horn on the head of that magnanimous saint.” “Saints” they were both 
—those Indians of “high and far-off times” were in the habit of building 
up tapas, “ascetic heat,” an instrument of the utmost cosmic “effi¬ 
ciency,” if we may style it thus.

It is not yet securely established what the word slppu means. 
(See W. Baumgartner, “Untersuchungen zu den akkadischen Bauaus- 
driicken,” ZA 36 [ 1925], pp. 27, 63; A. Schott, “Zu meiner Ubersetzung 
des Gilgamesh-Epos,” ZA 42 [1934], pp. 105b) For the style of this 
battle, characterized by Cyrus Gordon as “Beltwrestling” (JNES 7, 
p. 264), see A. Oppenheim, Or. 77, pp. 29F “They seized each other 
(by their girdles), like experts/ they wrestled./ They destroyed 
the doorpost/ The wall shook.” See also E. A. Speiser, “Akkadian 
Myths and Epics,” ANET, p. 78. This “doorpost” is no quantite 
negligeable , because some similar “object” comes our way again at the 
“entrance” of the Cedar Forest, and does the most devilish things to 
poor Enkidu. (Compare J. Friedrich, “Die hethitischen Bruchstiicke des 
Gilgamesh-Epos,” ZA 39 [1929-30], pp. 48F, dealing with the Hittite 
fragments; he established at least that it was not the bolt.) In fact, were 
we to have started from GE, instead of paying it a casual visit, the 
several “doors” with their “posts,” or “pillars,” with their “fillings” and 
“thresholds” would have had as much of a paralyzing effect upon us as 
the eye of Medusa. Meanwhile, detrimental translations are quite enough 
to turn the reader to stone.

also mean the fixed star Procyon, also n Dapinu should have this signifi¬ 
cance (Jensen, “der Furchtbare, Gewaltige (= Humbaba),” ZDMG 
67, S. 517)/’ (For the identification of Nusku with Mercury, see H. and 
J. Lewy, “The God Nusku,” Or. ij [1948], pp. 146-59.) See also 
Gossmann, 137 s.v. mul UD.AL.TAR: “I. Akkadian as much as umu

Handbuch der Babylonischen Astroiiomie (1915), p. 25. (For Procyon 
as part of Cancer, see RLA 5, p. 77; for al. lu 5 , representing sometimes 
the zodiacal sign Cancer, otherwise Procyon, see B. van der Waerden, 
“The Thirty-Six Stars,” JNES 8 [1949], p. 21.) 

Langdon {Semitic Mythology [1931 ], p. 268) mentions the identifica¬ 
tion Humbaba = Procyon, without giving the source, and without pay¬ 
ing heed to such notion. 

As concerns Humba with the determinant mul (Babylonian kakkab , re¬ 
spectively), Weidner (RLA 2, p. 389) informs us of the existence of 
two lists dealing with “7 astralen Enlil-Gottheiten.” List 1 states—we 
give it according to Weidner, since it is not essential, right here, to es¬ 
tablish whether or not his identifications are right throughout: “Perseus 
is the Enlil of Nippur, g Ursae Majoris is the Enlil of Enamtilla, alpha 
Cassiopeiae is the Enlil of Hursag-kalama, Columba is the Enlil of Kul- 
lab, Taurus is the Enlil of Aratta, k Humba ( = ?) is the Enlil of Suba 
(?)-Elam, Arcturus is the Enlil of Babylon.” List 2 omits mul Humba 
(compare also Weidner, Handbuch , pp. 58-60). Gossmann 188 states, 
pointing to F. Boll-C. Bezold {Antike Beobachtungen farbiger Sterne 
[ 1916], p. 121), that, according to VAT 0418 III 3, “ mul HUMBA re¬ 
places mul APIN.” The latter, the “plow constellation,” is triangulum and 
gamma Andromedae (see van der Waerden, JNES 8 , p. 13). 

Now it is of considerable interest to learn from Hiising ( Die ein - 
heimischen Quellen zur Geschichte Elams [1916], pp. 11, 95) that “the 
highest god of Elam . . . Humban (Hanubani, Hamban—Umman, 
Imbi)” is (supposedly) the same as Hanuman, the monkey-god, the 
crafty adviser of Rama (Hiising also takes Humban for a monkey); 
and from Charles Dupuis ( Orighie de tons les cidtes et toates les re- 
ligions [1795], vol. 5, p. 363) the following: “Dans l’explication 
des Fables Indiennes, nous avons toujours trouve que Procyon etoit le 
fameux singe Hanuman. II fixe le lever du Sagittaire, avec lequel le 
singe est en aspect (Kircher: Oedipus 2 II, p. 201).” 

Considering that Procyon has been counted among the stars of Can¬ 
cer, a constellation which had the name Nangar = Carpenter, the 




Hamlet’s Mill • 404 

Twelfth Tablet of GE, of pure Sumerian origin, might gain a com¬ 
pletely new' significance. Gilgamesh does, there, a lot of “wailing” and 
“lamenting” about some objects that he left (or failed to leave) there, 
w here they might have been in safety, in “the house of the Carpenter,” 
nangar. Apart from Procyon, the fixed representative of Jupiter and 
Mercury, once Humbaba is purged from his “ogrish” reputation, the 
time w ill have come to approach Kombabos and his doubles in Iranian 
and Indian mythology. 1 The story of young Kombabos, who castrated 
himself as a precaution w r hen he w T as appointed the traveling companion 
of “Caesar’s w ife,” has been hitherto incompatible with the “monster” of 
the cedar forest, although the scholars agree that the names Humbaba 
and Kombabos are identical. It would be worth investigating whether 
or not the proposed equation Humbaba = Mercury might also fit Kom¬ 
babos. F. K. Movers, however, w T as inclined to take Kombabos for 
Saturn. 2 


Appendix 27 


See A. Oppenheim, “Mesopotamian Mythology,” Or. /7 (1948), 
p. 40: “After Enkidu tossed towards her . . . what is euphemistically 
termed the ‘right thigh’ of the bull, the goddess and her devotees per¬ 
formed age-old rites over the part of the bull.” 

True as this statement certainly is, it does not explain much—nor is 
it even asked why it must be the right thigh ( imittn; compare H. 
Holma, Die Nanien der Korperteile im Assyrisch-Babylonischen [ 1911 ], 
pp. 13 if. See for the “euphemism” Holma, pp. 96f.). 

The consensus of the experts, in overlooking that the GE talks ex¬ 
plicitly of the celestial bull, keeps them from asking relevant questions, 
and their conviction that Mesopotamians and Egyptians had not much 
in common prevents them from recognizing the “bull’s thigh” when 

1 Lucian, “De Dea Syria,” in Lucian , trans. by A. M. Harmon, vol. 4 , cols. 19-27,

his example the priests of the Great Goddess castrated themselves and put on fe¬ 
male garments. See also F. Liebrecht, Des Gervasius von Tilbury Otia bnperialia

they see it. Yet it is there: Maskheti, the thigh of the bull Ursa Major, 
depicted on the astronomical ceilings in the tombs of Senmut, Seti, in 
the Ramesseum, etc. In Altaic mythology, Ursa turns into the leg of a 
stag; in Mexico we find it as the lost “foot" of Tezcatlipoca. 

The constellations are named according to a system, and if we meet 
“incomplete'’ or mutilated characters among them, we have to ask for 
the sufficient reason, e.g., why the ship Argo is a stern only, why 
Pegasus is barely half a horse—apart from its standing on its head 
and having wings—and why Taurus is the head and first third of a 
bull, his “thigh'’ turning around in the circumpolar region. Thus, it 
might be something to think about that in the Round Zodiac of Dendera 
(Roman period), the circumpolar “thigh” shows a ram sitting on it, 
looking back, moreover, as befits the zodiacal Aries (see F. J. Lauth, 
Zodiaques de Denderah [1865], p. 44). G. A. Wainwright, in “A Pair 
of Constellations,” Studies presented to F. L. Griffith (1932), p. 373, 
with reference to Benedite, mentions a thigh with the head of a ram 
from Edfu, called the “Foreleg of Khnum” (cf. Momnnenti delFEgitto 
e della Nubia, Ippolito Rosellini, ed. [1844], v °l- 3 - plate 24). 


Appendix 28 

In the GE Enkidu appears later on the stage of events than Gilga- 
mesh. This does not entitle us to take him for the prototype of the 
“younger brother” (see, e.g., W. Albright, “Gilgamesh and Engidu,” 
JAOS 40 [1920], pp. 312, 318). Actually, the hairy partner of the 
Twins, the “Dog,” is the prototype of the older one who is cheated out of 
his primogeniture in various ways. Esau, the hairy, is the first born; so is 
Plono-susori no Mikoto (Nihon gi, trans. by W. G. Aston [repr. i960], 
pp. 92-108; K. Florenz, Die historiscloen Quellen der Shinto-Religion 
[1919], pp. 204-21) who, together with his offspring, after having been 
passed by the Japanese “Jacob,” had to serve as “dogs,” as clowns, 
playactors, guardians of the imperial palace for eighty generations; at 
New Year and during coronation ceremonies these Hayahito had to 
bark three times. 

Particularly obvious is the case in Egypt, where we learn from FI. 
Kees (Der Gotterglaube im Alten Agypten [1956], p. 193, n. 3): “wtw 




1 Iamlet’s Mill • 406 


means ‘jackal’ and ‘the eldest,’ ” and it happens that Kees made this re¬ 
mark when dealing with a classical case of cheating: when Geb/Kronos 
declared 1 torus the eldest, cutting out Seth/Typhon completely, as 
reported in the Shabaka Inscription. Actually Geb claims Horus to be 
Upuaut, the Opener of the Way—Upuaut being the Upper Egyptian 
Jackal or Wolf. The complex of the “Dog-Twin” is, however, of such 
a size and weight that it cannot be attacked here. 

A particularly relevant and revealing case of inseparable “twins” 
comes our way in Cherokee mythology, where the thunder-boys are 
called “Little Men.” At the beginning we hear of one boy only, born 
in proper wedlock by “The Lucky Hunter” and “Corn,” but soon the 
boy “finds” his “Elder Brother” in the river, and the latter has the name 
“He-who-grew-up-wild.” These two arrange the world and human 
life as it is now, model cases of what ethnologists call “heroes of cul¬ 
ture.” Gilgamesh and Enkidu all over, they were asked to give “ver¬ 
dicts,” alias oracles, after they had finally left the “earth.” 1 


Appendix 29 


We might call it Lethe, and feel happy about it, were it not for the 
deplorable uncertainty of Lethe’s localization, with respect to the celes¬ 
tial itinerary of the soul particularly. The Milky Way being as large 
as it is, it does not help to state that one has to look for a galactical 
section. Worse, it remains unclear at which occasion the souls were 
supposed to drink from the water of this river of forgetfulness, whether 
they did so shortly after having arrived in Hades or before their re¬ 
incarnation, or at both times. Although the supposition of an intake of 
Lethe right at the entrance of Hades would deprive the underworld 
jurisdiction, together with the good or bad recompenses for former 
conduct, of its significance, both views were upheld. (See Stoll, in 
Roscher s.v. Lethe, col. 1957; O. Gruppe, Griechische Mythologie 
und Religionsgeschichte [1906], pp. 403-405, 1036-41. On p. 760, n. 8, 
Gruppe quotes a passage, according to which a soul which has not yet 
crossed the river Lethe comes back to molest the living.)

(Republic 10.620 ), and Virgil in the sixth book of the Aeneid (748- 
51), but only Macrobius ( Commentary on the Dream of Scipio , trans. 
by W. Stahl [1952], /. 12.8) pretends to know the source of the drink: 
the constellation Crater, the “bowl of Bacchus.” This does not make 
sense 1 but, anyhow, he makes the souls descend through the northern 
intersection of Galaxy and zodiac, taking the southern crossroads, be¬ 
tween Scorpius and Sagittarius for the entrance, which fits the “Hades- 
constellations” of the Sphaera barbarica. Yet we have observed, in 
other parts of our globe (see pp. 242F), some uncertainty concerning 
entrance and exit: the Nicaraguan “Mother Scorpion at the end of the 
Milky Way” receives the souls of the dead, and takes care of the babies 
going to be reborn, whereas the Cherokee appear to assume the entrance 
at the “Northern End” of the Milky Way (Gemini-Taurus), from 
where the souls migrate to the “Spirit-Star” in Scorpius. We are not 
informed precisely whether the souls follow the Milky Way for a 
whole half-circle, either turning to the north or to the south, or whether 
they go first in one direction and return later on the same way. The 
latter seems to be expressed in the Vishnu Parana which restricts the 
“Way of the Fathers” to the region on the north of Canopus, and south 
of three lunar mansions in Sagittarius and Scorpius; the “Road of the 
gods” ( devayana ) runs north of three lunar stations in Taurus and 
Aries, and south of the Seven Rishis, the Big Dipper. Vishnu Parana 2. 8 
(Wilson trans. [ 1961 ], p. 186) reads: 

On the north of Agastya, and south of the line of the goat [ Ayavithi, 

i.e., the said three nakshatras in Scorpius and Sagittarius] lies the road 

of the Pitris. There dwell the great Rishis, the offerers of oblation 

with fire, reverencing the Vedas, after whose injunctions creation 

1 Macrobius’ “uranography” is most embarrassing. He claims that “so long as the 
souls heading downwards still remain in Cancer they are considered in the com¬ 
pany of the gods, since in that position they have not yet left the Milky Way. But 
when in their descent they have reached Leo, they enter upon the first stages of 
their further condition . . . The soul, descending from the place where the Zodiac 
and the Milky Way intersect, is protracted in its downward course from a sphere, 
which is the only divine form, into a cone . . .” We have remarked already 
(p. 242) that Macrobius, in calling the “Gate of Cancer” the crossroads of 
Galaxy and zodiac, talks of signs , not of constellations. And so he does, when 
pinning down the “bowl of Bacchus”—Crater—“in the region between Cancer and 
Leo”: Crater is “between” Leo and Virgo, i.e., south of these constellations. How 
the souls, coming “down” from those crossroads of Galaxy and ecliptic, i.e., 
between Taurus and Gemini, should get hold of Lethe in Crater, south of Leo and 
Virgo, remains a mystery. Macrobius was, apparently, not in the habit of looking 
at the sky, and in this respect he was a very modern character.

commenced, and w ho were discharging the duties of ministrant 
priests: for as the worlds are destroyed and renewed, they institute 
new rules of conduct, and reestablish the interrupted ritual of the 
Vedas. Mutually descending from each other, progenitor springing 
from desccndcnt, and descendent from progenitor, in the alternating 
succession of births, they repeatedly appear in different houses and 
races along with their posterity, devout practices and instituted ob¬ 
servances, residing to the south of the solar orb, as long as the moon 
and the stars endure. 

In a similar direction might point the report given by Pausanias about 
the oracle of Trophonios in a deep cave (57.39.8): the visitor comes first 
to “ fountains of water very near to each other. 2 Here he must drink 
water called the w T ater of forgetfulness ( Lethes hydor), that he may 
forget all that he has been thinking of hitherto, and afterward he drinks 
of another w T ater, the w 7 ater of memory ( hydor mnemosynes) which 
causes him to remember what he sees after his descent.” Not enough, 
after the oracle has been given, and the inquirer ascended from the 
chasm (57.39.13), “he is again taken in hand by the priests, w ho set him 
upon a chair called the chair of memory (epi thronon mn.) and they 
ask of him, when seated there, all he has seen or learned. After gaining 
this information they then entrust him to his relatives. These lift him, 
paralyzed with terror and unconscious both of himself and of his sur¬ 
roundings . . . Afterwards, however, he will recover all his faculties, 
and the power to laugh will return to him.” 3 

Nor does this “chair of memory” remain without its partner: Apollo- 
dorus ( Epit . 7.24) tells us of the “Chair of Forgetfulness,” to which 
Theseus and Pirithous “grew and were held fast by coils of serpents.” 
That w r e learn also of “houses” of Lethe (Plutarch, Consolatio ad Appo- 
lonium , ch. 15, iioe, quoting an unknown poet) does not make this 
quarter more lucid. On the Etruscan Bronze Liver of Piacenza, let ham, 
the river, divides the lower—otherwise empty—side into approximately 
equal parts—the invisible southern arch of the Milky Way? 

2 So are the rivers of lust and mourning (Hedone and Lype) of Theopompus 
(Book 8 of his Philippika ) which have been compared to our rivers by E. Rohde 
(“Zum griechischen Roman,” Rh. Mus. 48 [1893], PP- I2 3f-)- I n Polynesia we meet 
near together the “water of life” and the “water of death” (see R. Williamson, 
Religious and Cosmic Beliefs of Central Polynesia [1924], vol. /, pp. 334, 344; vol. 
2, pp. 169L). 

3 Of considerable interest are several terrestrial rivers called Lethe, mentioned 
by Gruppe ( Griechische Mythologie [1906], p. 817): they are flowing at the foot 
of several “White Rocks” (Leuketes skopelos ), one among which has the name 
agelastos petre , the laughterless rock.

Considering this state of confusion and uncertainty, we abstain from 
calling it rightaway either the drink of forgetfulness or the drink of 
memory, although one or both of them could very well be found upon 
the shelves of Ishara tamtim, alias Mother Scorpion.

We might be accused of a clumsy contradiction because of having 
claimed Sirius to be the “Sea-Star” in appendix #2, when here it is evi¬ 
dent that Ishara tamtim, the goddess of Scorpius, is entitled to this dig¬ 
nity. We are not only aware of this apparent “contradiction,” but we 
also hope to unravel the mystery in the future. It is a mysterious 
scheme, but not a hopeless case. Clue number one is contained in the 
Coptic list of lunar mansions, already mentioned in appendix #4 (cf. A. 
Kircher, Oedipus Aegyptiacus [1653], vol. 2, pt. 2, p. 246), where it is 
stated with respect to the twentieth lunar mission, the sting of the scor¬ 
pion (lambda upsilon Scorpii): “Aggia, Sancta, Arabice al-Sa’ula [i.e., 
“the sting”]; statio translations caniculae in coelum, unde et siot vocatur 
. . . Longitudo huius stationis est a quarto Sagittarii usque ad decimum 
septimum eiusdem. Haec statio ab Aegyptiis quoque vocatur soleka sive 
Astrokyon . . . statio venationis.” Eduard Stucken (Der Ur sprung des 
Alphabets und die Mondstationen [1913], p. 7) identified this soleka 
immediately with Egyptian Selket/Serqet, the Mesopotamian Ishara 
tamtim, the Scorpion goddess. Whether or not this is permissible under 
the stern laws of linguists, it is a fact that we find regularly on the 
Egyptian astronomical ceilings Selket standing above, i.e., beyond, the

hull’s thigh (Big Dipper), which means that Sclkct represents the oppo¬ 
sition to the perpetual center of attention: Sirius/Sothis. (Yes, we arc 
aware of the circumstance that fourteen degrees is no ideal opposi¬ 
tion to one star.) Clue number two arc the stories spun around Indian 
vmra, “the root” (or “tcarcr out of the root”), again lambda upsilon 
Scorpii—compare appendices #4 and #39—which have to be combined 
with the ocean of most atrocious yarns dealing with Mandragora 
(Alraun), the famous root that can be pulled out only by a dog that 
dies immediately after having completed this feat. Clue number three is 
carefully hidden away in the Mexican traditions concerned with the 
hunting festival Quecholli ( statio venatioms , and Quecholli is not to 
be separated from the ‘‘hunt” for hikuli , the peyote, as undertaken by 
Huichol and Tarahumare), which rehearses the great “fall” of the gods 
who had plucked the forbidden flowers, in Tamoanchan, “the house of 
descending.” 


Appendix 3 / 


These unknown factors, crucial as they are, resist successfully every 
decoding for the time being. Su-ut abne, “those of stone,” represent “an 
expression which recurs and has not been explained” (S. Langdon, 
Semitic Mythology [1931], pp. 213C, 405). Alexander Heidel ( The 
Gilgamesh Epic and Old Testament Parallels [1963], p. 74, n. 157) re¬ 
marks: “The Hittite Version has ‘two images of stone.’ These images 
may perhaps have been idols of an apotropaic character enabling 
Urshanabi to cross the waters of death.” Speiser (“Akkadian Myths and 
Epics,” ANET, p. 91, n. 173) makes it “apparently stone figures of 
unusual properties ...” 

^According to Speiser (Assyrian version, Tabl. 10, col. 3, 37E, ANET, 
p. 92; cf. Heidel, p. 76) Urshanabi states: “Thy hands, Gilgamesh, have 
hindered [the crossing!: Thou hast broken the Stone Things . . . ,” 
which can hardly be correct, since they do cross, after all. 

F. AI. Th. de Liagre Bohl, in his translation of GE, seems to have 
boldly claimed that the “stone objects” were “part of the fence of 
Siduri’s yard,” to which I. Al. Diakonoff (Review article on the GE 






411 • Appendices 

translations of F. AI. Th. Bohl and P. L. Matous, Bibliotheca Orientals 
18 [1961], p. 65) remarked: “The sut abne cannot have any connection 
with Siduri’s yard (indeed, no such yard is mentioned).” 

Luckenbill (i\JSL 38 [1922], pp. 96-102) seems to have voted for 
anchors (see Gilgamesh et sa legende, ed. by P. Garelli [1958], p. 17, 
item 146). Orally, three years ago, Florence Day proposed “load 
stones.” For further keen propositions, see A. Salonen, Die Wasserfahr- 
zenge in Babylonien (1939), pp. 13 if. 

Some new light falls upon these objects through a Neo-Babylonian 
fragment published by D. J. Wiseman ( Gilgamesh et sa legende , 
pp. 128-30), but the author himself states that the new reading (u su-ut 
NA 4 .AIES) “appears at present to help little towards the understanding 
of this much discussed term. The restoration of parts of 11 .3 5-41, now 
possible, shows that the end of this column describes the manner in 
which Gilgamesh met Ur-shanabi and obtained the boat and its equip¬ 
ment for his journey over the ‘waters of death.’ 

When Gilgamesh heard this, 
he took up the axe in his hand, 
drew the dagger from the belt, 
crept along and went down . . . 

Like a lance he fell among them . . . 
within the forest he sat down and . . . 

Ur-shanabi saw the flashing of the dagger, 
heard the axe and . . . 

Then he smote his head . . . Gilgamesh 
seized the wings ... its breast 
and the sutabne .. . the boat.. .” 

More annoying still, these stone-things are not the only vexing items 
to be found in the neighborhood of Urshanabi. Heidel simply drops 
them, and renders line 29 of the Assyrian version (Tabl. 10, col. 2, 
p. 74): “With him are the stone images (?), in the woods he picks . . . , ” 
and accordingly he deals with column 3, 38b: only the stone-things are 
mentioned. Speiser (ANET, p. 91) continues after the “Stone-Things”: 
“In the woods he picks [ £ z/n 77 /’-snakes].” And column 3 he renders: 
“Thou hast broken the Stone Things, hast picked [the ‘urnu’-snakes]. 
The Stone Things are broken, the ‘urnu’ is not [in the woods].” 



Hamlet’s Mill 


• 412 


In note 174 Speiser refers to Landsberger (Die Fauna des Alten Meso¬ 
potamia! [ 1934], p. 63), who “points out that the urnu snake has long 
been supposed to be a favorite w ith sailors. At all events, whatever the 
meaning of the term may be in the present connection, its properties 
seem to be on a par with those of the Stone Things.” 

Now, let us first express our disapproval of Urshanabi’s lack of “fair¬ 
ness,” just in ease this translation might be correct: Siduri states it as 
well known that “Urshanabi, with whom are the stone-things, picks 
urnu-snakes” in the woods, and here he accuses Gilgamesh of having 
done so, taking it, evidently, for an improper thing to do! In the second 
line, B. Landsberger ( Fauna, p. 63; cf. pp. 45L, 52, 60) identified tenta¬ 
tively the “urnu-snake” (maybe also “the yellow (green) snake,” mus. 
sig 7 . sig 7 ) with the waran, and considers, since even today warans are 
eaten, that the urnu w r ere collected in order to serve as roast meat for the 
sailors. He thinks it possible that in later times “urnu” was meant as 
“land-crocodile.” If urnus belonged to the usual travel provisions, why 
should the picking of these animals be an impediment for the crossing 
of the waters of death? Although one should not criticize others, least 
of all scholars of the rank of Landsberger, if one has no positive propo¬ 
sitions to offer, reading through this learned work, it becomes less and 
less comprehensible how r he could misapprehend these animals, particu¬ 
larly the snakes, for a veritable terrestrial fauna, these seven-headed, 
one-eyed, unicorned creatures belonging to Anu, Nergal, Ningishzida, 
etc. 


Appendix 32 


Considering that removed posts or pegs, pulled-out pins, wrecked 
axles, and felled trees have accompanied this whole investigation as a 
kind of basso ostinato, we cannot pass in silence over these superimpor- 
tant posts; considering, on the other hand, that technical details are not 
likely to make pleasant reading, we prefer to deal with this specimen 
outside the main text, although we deem it essential indeed. 

The object that Irragal is tearing out is called tarkullu, Sumerian 
DIM.GAL, which has been translated into “(Anchor-)post,” “ship’s 
mast,” “mooring-post” (Heidel), also “anchor” itself, and even “steer-

ing-oar” (Jensen). 1 In the Era Epic, Era (=Irragal=Nergal), when 
announcing a new catastrophe, threatens that he is going to tear out the 
tarkullu, that he will make the ship drift off, break the steering oar so 
that the ship cannot land, and remove the mast and all that belongs to it. 2 

We meet the word also in names given to temples, as we learn from 
Burrows, 3 who considers “the evidence for the relation of the temples 
to (1) heaven, (2) earth, (3) underworld,” and tells us what follows: 

(1) The idea of the Bond of Heaven and Earth is given explicitly. 
Dur-an-ki, was the name of sanctuaries at Nippur, at Larsa, and prob¬ 
ably at Sippar. Also in Semitic markas same u irsiti, Bond of Heaven 
and Earth, is used of the temple E-hursag-kur-kur-ra and of Babylon. 

(2) Idea of Bond of the Land. Probably by extension of religious 
use the royal palace of Babylon is called markas (bond) of the Land. 
An ancient Sumerian temple-name, which probably expresses an 
analogous idea, is u dim gal of the Land.” This was the name of the 
temple of Der, an old Sumerian center beyond the Tigris; a name 
given to Gudea’s temple at Lagash; a temple of Sauska of Niniveh; 
and probably the temple of Nippur was another u dimgal of the 
Land.” The pronunciation and meaning of dimgal are disputed. 
“Great binding-post” is perhaps a fair translation. The religious terms 
u dimgal of the Land” and the like perhaps indicate the temple as a 
kind of towering landmark which was a center of unity by its height. 

(3) Idea of the bond with the underworld. Gudea uses dimgal also 
with reference to the abzu , i.e., the waters of the underworld: he laid 
two temens, ritual foundations—the temen “above” or “of heaven” 
and the temen “of the abzu and the latter is called “great dimgal .” 
The idea may be that the temple is as it were a lofty column, stretch¬ 
ing up to heaven and down to the underworld—the vertical bond of 
the world. The same passage mentions, it seems, a place of libation 

1 See P. Jensen, Die Kosmologie der Babylonier (1890), pp. 377, 422L; K. Tall- 
qvist, Akkadische Gotterepitheta (1934), p. 244 (see also p. 283; Dim gul-an-na 
“Himmelspfahl” = Ninurta, and Dim gulkalam-ma “Weltpfahl” = Ninurta). See 
C. Bezold, Babylonisch-Assyrisches Glossar (1926), p. 296: “Pfahl, Priigel, Schiffs- 
pfahl, Mast”; A. Salonen, Nautica Babylotiiaca (1942), p. 85; “(Anker)pfahl.” On p. 
104 Salonen explains tarkidla as “the mast,” and it is the mast of Ea’s ship: “sein (des 
Ea-Schiffs) Mast ist in der Schiffsmitte aufgestcllt, schwebt am Himmelsband.” See

to the god of the underworld. Drains or pipes apparently destined 
for libations to the underworld have been discovered at Ur. Thus, if 
these interpretations are right, the temples expressed not only, in 
their height, the idea of the bond with heaven but also, in their depth, 
that of union with the netherworld. 

Were we to hear less of “towering landmarks” and “lofty columns,” 
for the sake of being presented with one single thought dedicated to the 
fact that these alleged “temples” and “columns” were torn out in order 
to start a deluge, we would be better off. Much more astonishing, how¬ 
ever, is the circumstance that nobody seems to have taken the trouble 
of looking for relevant enlightenment in Egypt, i.e., of dealing with the 
Egyptian mnj.t. 

According to Erman-Grapow ( Worterbuch der Aegyptischen 
Sprache [1957], vol. 2, pp. 7zff.) the word is used as (1) symbolical 
expression for the king (als Lenker des Staatsschiffes); (2) symbolical 
expression for Isis and Nephthys who fetched Osiris from the water. 
It is a constellation, the instrument for impaling, the post to which a 
person to be punished is bound. The transitive verb ( mnj) means to 
bind to a post, to tether (anpflocken); the intransitive verb means to 
land, from persons, and from ships, and to die, sometimes supplemented 
“at Osiris” (bei Osiris landen). 

This mnj.t wr.t —Mercer writes it min.t —the “great landing stick,” 4 
is said “to mourn” for the soul of the dead in the Pyramid Texts, 5 and 
Mercer comments 6 that “the great stake ... is personified as a ‘mourn¬ 
ing woman’ in reference here to Isis.” The “mooring-post” being a con¬ 
stellation, as even the Worterbuch der Aegyptischen Sprache has to ad¬ 
mit, the question is where to look for this mnj.t. The constellation— 
transcribed menat by Brugsch, 7 mnit by Neugebauer 8 —occurs in two 
categories of astronomical monuments, namely (1) in the Ramesside 

4 See W. Max Muller, Egyptian Mythology (1918), p. 376, n. 79. 

^Pyramid Texts , ed. by S. Mercer (1952), p. 794c: “The great min.t (-stake) 
mourns for thee”; cf. 876c, 884b (“the great min.t laments for thee, as for Osiris 
in his suffering”), and 2013b. 

6 Pyramid Texts , vol. 2, p. 399; see also p. 361. See pp. 371, 398 for mini “to 
pasture, to land (i.e., to die),” and for min.u derived from mini, as an epithet of 
Anubis 793c: “he who is upon the minim”). “The min.w here seems to indicate a 
cask for the limbs of Osiris.” 

* H. Brugsch ( Thesaurus laser ip tionwn Aegyptiacorum [1883-91; repr. 1968], 
pp. 122, 130, 188) takes it for a “knife” or “sword”; later ( Die Aegyptologie 
[1891], p. 343) he spelled it “ship’s peg” (“Schiffspflock” and “Doppelpflock”).

Star Clocks, 9 and (2) in the ceiling pictures of royal tombs, in the 
zodiacs of Dendera, etc. In every case the peg or post rests in the hands 
of Isis disguised as a hippopotamus; fastened to the mooring-post is a 
rope or chain, to the other end of which is tied Maskheti , the bull’s 
thigh, i.e., the Big Dipper, and in one of the texts it is stated (Brugsch, 
Thesaurus , p. 122) that “it is the office of Isis-Hippopotamus to guard 
this chain.” 

According to the Ramesside Star Clocks, nmj.t included six different 
parts, 10 and only after these six parts follow rrt “female hippopotamus,” 
comprising eight positions. Boll (Sploaera [1903], p. 222) remarks that 
this constellation must be thought of as being parallel to either the 
equator or the zodiac, and as being rather “long,” because otherwise it 
could not need more than four hours of ascending. 

Most of the scholars dealing with the Egyptian astronomical ceilings 
took it for granted that the main scenery represented the northern cir¬ 
cumpolar constellations, because the Big Dipper, Maskheti, holds the 
“determinant” position upon the stage, and they tried their hardest to 
identify Isis-Hippopotamus holding the mooring-post, and carrying 
upon her back a crocodile, with a constellation very near the Pole. 
Now, we do not mean to go into details of the Egyptian sphere as 
represented in these ceiling decorations, which is an extremely difficult 
task, and nothing has been gained in the past by the different efforts to 
settle the affair by simply looking at the sky (worse, at sky-maps) try¬ 
ing to imitate Zeus by “catasterizing” on one’s own account, and giv¬ 
ing keen verdicts. Let us say only this much: (1) as yet no single 
proposition concerning the Hippopotamus holding the mooring-post is 
satisfying; 11 (2) that the determinative group of the ceiling pictures 

9 Formerly they were called “Theban hour-tables” (Thebanische Stimdentafeln, 
or Thebanische Tafeln stiindlicher Anfgauge). 

10 Neugebauer and Parker, “The Ramesside Star Clocks,” p. 7: (1) the “prede¬ 
cessor,” or the “front of the mooring post,” (2) “is not translatable,” (3) “follower 
of the front of the mooring post,” (4) “mooring post,” (5) “follower of the moor¬ 
ing post,” (6) “follower which comes after the mooring post.” 

11 We hope for enlightenment to be contained in the third volume of Neuge- 
bauer’s Egyptian Astronomical Texts. In vol. 2, p. 7 he states, with respect to the 
hour-stars: “To what extent, if at all, the constellations of the lion, the mooring 
post, the hippopotamus, and perhaps others, can be identified with similar figures 
in the so-called ‘ northern ’ constellations as depicted on many astronomical ceilings 
... is a problem into which we do not intend to enter until all the evidence can 
be presented in our final volume. That the problem is more complex than would 
appear at first glance—at least in so far as the two hippopotami are concerned— 
is sufficiently indicated by the fact that on the ceilings the hippopotamus is never 




Hamlet’s Mill • 416 


show decisive factors of the “frame”: Leo, Scorpius, Taurus, 12 serving 
thus as a kind of “key” of the whole presentation. 13 But, if our “frame” 
is meant, i.e., the structure of colures, where is the southern celestial 
landscape? We do not dare to molest the reader with the impenetrable 
text (Brugsch, Thesaurus , p. 122), out of which we quoted only one 
sentence which states that Isis-Hippopotamus is guarding the chain; this 
much at least is recognizable, that this text jumps from the Big Dipper— 
via “the middle of the sky”—to positions “South of Sah-Orion.” 

And here Casanova 14 comes in quite handy with his proposition to un¬ 
derstand vmj.t (he writes it menat) as Menouthis, the wife of Canopus, 
steersman of Alenelaus, whom we know from late Greek texts (also writ¬ 
ten Eumenouthis). Epiphanius 15 talks of the tomb of both, i.e., Canopus 
and his wife, in Alexandria. Stephanus of Byzantium knows of a village 
“at Kanobos” which had the name Menouthis. 16 It would lead us too far 
to deal with Canopus-steersman-of-Alenelaus, and the Canopic mouth 


named rrt, never is shown with two feathers as a headdress, and very frequently 
has a crocodile on its back.” (We are only too grateful for everybody who recog¬ 
nizes that the problems are “more complex”—a hundred times more complex, 
indeed—“than would appear.” The underlining of “so-called ‘northern’ ” is ours; 
that of the two “never’s” is Neugebauer’s.) 

12 That the Dipper is said to be the thigh of a bull indicates Taurus clearly 
enough; we have mentioned that there is also a “foreleg of Khnum” available, i.e., 
that of a ram, and that in Dendera a ram is sitting on the Ursa-Leg: whose leg it is 
depends from the constellation marking the vernal equinox. To the objection that 
the constellation as depicted in Egyptian pictures clearly shows the hindleg of an 
ox, we have to answer that the texts insist on talking about the bull’s foreleg; in 
other words, the real resemblance does not count so much, apparently (cf. appen¬

showing in the center, precisely below Maskheti, the baboon sitting upon the 
Djed-pillar—we know from Horapollo (/. 16) that the squatting baboon indicates 
the equinoxes; whereas the third, lowest register shows the sitting dogs at both ends, 
and we know from Clemens Alexandrinus {Strom. 5.7, 45.3) that these represent 
the Tropics.

[of Horus], and later this was identified with Madagascar as the most remote 
island in the south, i.e., the lower world.” Muller seems to take Menouthis for the

of the Nile: the modern Homo occidentals is bound to shrink back from 
the mere idea that the Nile represented a circle, where “source” and 
“mouth” meet, so that there is nothing preposterous in the notion that a 
Canopic mouth can be found in the geographical North, and here it 
is not necessary to discuss the question. It is sufficiently striking to see 
the mooring-post “married” to Canopus in a similar manner as Ur- 
shanabi is “married” to Nanshe, Enki’s daughter, to whom is con¬ 
secrated the holy stern of the ship. 

Admittedly, we know as little as before where precisely the mn].t of 
the star clocks has to be looked for, 17 but we have at least made it more 
plausible that DIM.GAL /tarkidlu/nmj.t must be the decisive plumb line 
connecting the inhabited world with the celestial South Pole or, let us 
say, with the orbis antarcticus: Osiris being depicted as a circle (see 
Brugsch, Religion und Mythologie , plate facing p. 216), the verb mnj.t , 
“to land (at Osiris),” points in this direction. (We recall once more 
Virgil’s statement that the “shades infernal” and Styx see the South 
Pole.) It has not escaped our attention that GE //. 101 seems to talk 
of posts, in the plural: as, in some Egyptian texts, we have the “double 
mnj.t.” We do not know yet why: the Era Epic uses the singular, but 
Era is going to pull out a different post from the one he had torn out 
previously in GE under his name Irragal. There are possible solutions, 
but we leave alone this question as well as the next difficult problem 
arising with the suspicious similarity of the ship’s peg with the nose- 
bone of the Horus-Eye (numerical value 1/64), however tempting this 
problem is. 


same as Thermouthis, the daughter of that Pharaoh who found Moses in the Nile 
(cf. Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 2. 9.5-7, 224; Bk. Jub. XLvii.5: Tharmuth), 
without giving sources or reasons for doing so. We should very much like to know 
whether or not mnj.t is identical, or has something to do at all with “Menat or 
Heliopolis,” whom Brugsch identified with Satit of Elephantine (of all deities!); 
it w r ould be decisive to know it. (Cf. Brugsch, Religion und Mythologie [1891], 
p. 30 r; Brugsch, Thesaurus [1883-91; repr. 1968], p. 107.) 

17 Some years ago, a mathematician in Frankfurt, who had invested much com¬ 
puter time in the star clocks, felt sure that mnj.t must end in alpha Centauri. As 
concerns the astronomical ceilings, we have presumably to mind the manner in 
which the late zodiacs of Dendera and Esne (Roman time) “project” the Big 
Dipper /Maskheti, the bull’s thigh (together with Isis-Hippopotamus and the 
chain) into the zodiac, namely, between Scorpius and Sagittarius (Esne), and 
between Sagittarius and Capricornus (Dendera). There is, moreover, a remarkable 
Arabian survival (R. Boker, quoting Chwolson [1859], in A. Schott’s translation 
of Aratus, Sternbilder und Wetterzeichen [1958], p. 119) stating to Sagittarius 
degree 30: “To the right of the degree is Meshkedai, the moulder of divine images.”

Appendix 55 


The mere notion of the emperors sleeping makes it clear that they are 
expected to awake and to return one day; 1 be it Quetzalcouatl (in the 
heart of the sea), Ogygian Kronos himself, or Arthur, “ruler of the 
lower hemisphere,” who announces in a fictitious letter “that he has 
come, with a host of antipodean subjects” 2 —according to Etienne de 
Rouen (c. 1169; see R. S. Loomis [ed.], Arthurian Literature in the 
Middle Ages [1959], P- 69); that Geoffrey of Viterbo placed Arthur 
straightaway into the depth of the sea has been mentioned on p. 299, 
n. 35. 

Few scholars only, among them Franz Kampers and Robert Eisler, 
have recognized the awe-inspiring age of such traditions, and even they 
have been incapable of calling the much-expected “redeemer” and “kos- 
mokrator” by his very own name: Saturn. Says Kampers, concerning 
the apocryphal Apocalypsis of Daniel : 3 

Alexander wird hier . . . nicht mit seinem Namen genannt, sondern 
er wird als Johannes eingefuhrt. Nach all dem Gesagten wird es nicht 
mehr allzu kiihn erscheinen, in diesem Namen Johannes eine pro- 
phetische Chiffre zu erkennen. Wenn Nimrod in einer altslawischen 
Sage auch Johannes heisst, wenn der erdichtete Erretterkonig der 
Kreuzfahrer, wie wir sehen werden, Johannes genannt [=Prester 
John] und auch in Beziehung gesetzt wird zu dem Weltenbaum, so 
diirfte die Annahme, dass hier fortlebende altorientalische Oannes- 
Erwartungen sich aussern, nicht von der Hand zu weisen sein. 

And right here, he refers to Robert Eisler’s chapter, “John-Oannes?” 
which states : 4 

We should not hesitate even to presuppose that the same syncretism 
of John and Oannes, which seems so natural with Neo-Babylonian 
Gnostics [the Mandaeans are meant], existed also among the more 
immediate Jewish followers of the Baptist, seeing that an influence

2 This role is otherwise ascribed to Beli (or Bilis), brother of Bran, “the dwarf 
King of the Antipodes”—later he had the name Pelles. “In Welsh poetry the sea is 
referred to as Beli’s liquor and the waves as Beli’s cattle” (R. S. Loomis, The Grail 
[1963], pp. 110-12). “Elsewhere he is implored as ‘victorious Beli . . . that will 
preserve the qualities of the honey-isle of Beli’ ” (McCulloch, in ERE 3, p. 290).

of the Babylonian belief in ever new incarnations of the primeval 
Oannes—Berossos knows as many as six such reincarnations in past 
times—on the Messianic hopes of the later Jews is far from credible. 
In ch. 12f. of IV Esra (temp. Domitian, 81-96 a . d .), the redeemer of 
the world, the celestial “Man” is expected to rise from the “heart of 
the Ocean” before his coming, as Daniel (7.13) says, with the clouds 
of the sky, for: “As no man can search or discover that which is in 
the depths of the Ocean, even so no mortal can see the Son of God 
nor his hosts except in the hours of His day.” 

Accordingly, we find in 4 Ezra xm.3 (in E. Kautzsch [ed.], Psendo- 
epigraphen des Alten Testaments [1900]) the sixth vision of the pro¬ 
phet: “Ich schaute, siehe da fiihrte jener Sturm aus dem Herzen des 
Meeres etwas wie einen Mann hervor.” In a note (p. 395) the Latin 
translation of the Syriac version is quoted: “Et vidi et ecce ipse ventus 
ascendere faciebat de corde maris tanquam similitudinis hominis.” 

We know well enough that the Oannes of Berossos is Ea, i.e., Saturn, 
whose “town” is Eridu/Canopus, the very depth of the sea. That Ogy- 
gian Kronos is unmistakably the planet Saturn is not to be overlooked 
by anyone who reads Plutarch’s report (De facie quae in or be lunae 
apparet 941) of the “servants” of Kronos who—every thirty years, 
when Saturn is standing in Taurus—sail to Ogygia to remain there in 
service for thirty years, after which they are free to go; but most of 
them prefer to stay, because there, in Saturn’s island, the Golden Age 
lasts on and on. The servants spend their whole time on mathematics, 
philosophy, and the like, and there is no reason to worry about food, 
it is all conveniently at hand. 

The reluctance at recognizing the almost uncanny power of the old¬ 
est traditions is a very modern invention. Kampers still knew very well 
that the “type” of the medieval emperor was coined in the most ancient 
Near East, Alexander being a “repetition” of Gilgamesh, and the em¬ 
peror repeating Alexander again and again. (Cf. Kampers, Vom Werde- 
gange , pp. 2 if., 35, and passim.) 


Appendix 34 


Actually, we are up against a completely incomprehensible narrative 
of events which occurred during a sea voyage. The plant, according to 
Albright (AJSL 56, p. 281, n. 2) literally “thorny grapevine,” is sup- 


Hamlet’s Mill • 420 


posed to grow in the apsu, and to be accessible by way of a “water- 
pipe.” fhis pipe, ratUj however, is a conjecture right here: the word 
occurs only later when, after his bath in a well, and the following loss 
of the plant, Gilgamcsh complains bitterly about his frustration, i.c., 
about having obtained a boon for the “earth lion” instead of for himself. 
The “earth lion,” identified with the thievish serpent, is assumed in its 
turn to live “in a well which communicated with the apsu” (Albright, 
AJSL p. 194). It is then (GE /7.298) that the hero says: “When 
I opened the water-pipe and [. . .] the gear, I found that which has 
been placed as a sign for me: I shall withdraw and leave the boat on the 
shore” (Speiser trails., ANET, pp. 96f.). Heidel makes it: “When I 
opened the ... I have found something that [has been s]et for a sign 
unto me; I will withdraw!” Instead of that “sign,” Albright (RA 16, 
pp. 175L) recognized a flood rising out of the pipe (if so, why does 
Gilgamesh talk about it only after his bath in the well?): “When I 
opened the water-pipe, I overturned the cover (?). Let not the sea rise 
to my side, b[efo]re (it) let me retire”; and so did Ungnad-Gressmann 
(pp. 63L) and Schmoekel (p. in). From this passage the translators 
derive the occurrence of the word ratu in the earlier passage, where 
Gilgamesh dives for the plant. Speiser alone 1 refers to another occasion 
where the word is used, and it is a decisive occasion; namely, in the 
(wrongly called) “Eridu creation story” (v. 11), where it is told that 
before anything was created and when all lands were sea (tamtim), 
then “the spring which is in the sea was a water pipe; then Eridu was 
made, Esagila was built” (Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis [1963], 
pp. 6if.). Sayce (ERE 4, p. 129) makes it a “current” within the sea; 
with Jensen ( Assyrisch-Babylonische My then ztnd Epen [1909], p. 41) 
it is a “Wasserbecken”; with Ebeling (AOTAT, pp. 130L) a “Schoepf- 
rinne.” Considering that Eridu is Canopus, and Esagila is “ 1 -Iku”— 
the Pegasus-square between the two Fishes that ruled the hibernal sol¬ 
stice during the Age of Gemini—this particular ratu seems to have been 
the connection between the two depths of the sea, between Pisces as the 
depth of the salt sea and Canopus as the depth of the apsu, the sweet 
water ocean. 

1 ANET, p. 96, n. 232. The conclusions drawn from this footnote by N. K. 
Sandars in his rendering of the GE in the form of a “straightforward narrative” 
are, as is his whole undertaking, a willful misrepresentation of the truth, unless one 
accepts the whisking away of the 1001 stumbling blocks and obscurities and the 
fabrication of a “Gilgamesh made easy” for a praiseworthy progress (Gilgamesh 
Epic [i960], pp. 53, 113).

Although it is probable that the conception of one or more such 
“pipes” is the same as the Jewish one of the “channels,” shithim , that 
went down to the tehom and were dug by God during the creation, 
this is not the place to deal broadly with this plot. In any case, Gilga- 
mesh opening one or the other ratu comes close to David, who, when 
digging such a channel, found the Eben Shetiyyah. The relevant (and 
revealing) material has been assembled by D. Feuchtwang in his article, 
“Das Wasseropfer und die damit verbundenen Zeremonien,” Alonats-

Of remarkable interest are pieces of information dealt with by Lang- 
don (MAR j, pp. 227-29) coming from Nicander, and Aelianus ( De 
natura animalium 6.51), who in his turn refers to Sophocles, 2 and several 
poets whose works are lost. Aelianus—to whom, by the way, we are 
indebted for the only mention of our hero’s name in Greek literature 
(De natura animalium 12.21: Gilgamos)—when dealing with a particu¬ 
larly fiendish small snake called Dipsas (literally “thirst”), tells the fol¬ 
lowing: 

It is said that Prometheus stole fire, and the myth goes that Zeus was 
angered and bestowed upon those who laid information of the theft 
a drug to ward off old age. So they took it, as I am informed, and 
placed it upon an ass. The ass proceeded with the load on its back; 
and it was summer time, and the ass came thirsting to a spring in its 
need for a drink. Now the snake which was guarding the spring 
tried to prevent it and force it back, and the ass in torment gave it 
as the price of the loving-cup the drug that it happened to be carry¬ 
ing. And so there was an exchange of gifts: the ass got his drink and 
the snake sloughed his old age, receiving in addition, so the story 
goes, the ass’s thirst. fThe Sophocles fragment says that since then, 
snakes slough their old skin every year, kath’hekaston eniauton.] 

Nicander, as quoted by Langdon, supplements the story by telling us 
of the date when this “exchange of gifts” took place, namely, on the 
occasion of a new distribution of the “Three Ways,” reporting “that 
when Cronus’ eldest son became master of Heaven, he divided up in 
his wisdom glorious governments among his brethren, and gave youth 
as a reward to short-lived men; so honouring them, because they dis¬ 
closed the thief of fire, fools that they were! for they got no gain from 
their evil counsel.”

Appendix 55 


There are a few dim and blurred signals to be received from the 
regions of Styx flowing, as we have heard, in sight of the celestial South 
Pole. Photius 1 tells us about Hyllos, son of Herakles, who had a small 
horn grow ing out of the left side of his head, and how Epopeus 2 of 
Sikyon broke off this horn, after having killed Hyllos in a duel, fetched 
Styx w'ater w ith this horn, and became king of the country. Why should 
he have procured this much dreaded water, if it did not enable him to 
become king? 

Allegedly “late” are the legends claiming that Thetis made the child 
Achilles invulnerable by means of Styx water—his heel excepted, as \vt 
know. On the other hand it was fabled that Alexander was killed with 
w'ater from the Styx, as Pausanias, who remained skeptical, reported (see 
also p. 201, n. 8). Thus, both of them were brought in touch with 
Stygian w T ater, the one almost at the right moment, but only almost, 
and the other at a completely wrong time, far aw^ay from that unknown 
day in the year, w r here this fluid was supposed to make the drinker 
immortal, whereas it brought inevitable death on every other day.

For related conceptions in Rome, see Festus (128x1, BT [1965],

ford (“The Eleusinian Mysteries,” in Festschrift Ridgeway [1913], pp. 
i6off.) about Greek underground structures, “ phrear , the equivalent of 
the Latin puteus.” And about the “Curtius-Lake,” Lacus Curtius—repre¬ 
senting a mundus —which was to be found, according to Dion. Hal. 
2.42, en meso tes Romaion agoras, i.e., right in the middle of the Forum 
(see also Festus 49M, p. 42). Cornford explains (p. 162, note): 

The legend of Curtius, whose self-devotion stopped a flood, and who 
was honoured with dona ac frnges thrown into his lakkos , may throw 
light on the custom at Athens of throwing wheatmeal kneaded with 
honey into the cleft in the ground at the precinct of Ge Olympia 
where the water ran away after Deukalion’s flood, Fans. /. 1 8.7. 

The well, closed by a stone—here even by a veritable Roman general 
and his horse—is not unfamiliar to us, meanwhile, after all that we heard 
about Eben Shetiyyah, the well of the Ka’aba, etc. There are more 
curious connections between wells and stones that ask for consideration 
in future investigations, such as the following three items: 

(1) The stone that was given by the Child to the Wise Men of the 
East, according to a legend picked up by Marco Polo. “The Magi did 
not understand the significance of the stone and cast it into a well. Then 
straightaway there descended from Heaven a fire which ‘they carried 
into their own country and placed it in a rich and beautiful church.’ ” 
L. Olschki 1 mentions also the Uigur version of this story, where “the 
stone is detached by the Child from His crib and thrown into a well 
because of its overwhelming weight which frustrated all human and 
animal efforts to carry it away. A column of fire reaching the blue sky 
is said to have risen from the well into which the stone had fallen and 
to have kindled the fire worshiped by the Magi ‘up to our days.’ ” 

(2) The star of the Magi which fell into the well of Bethlehem, 
according to Gervase of Tilbury, 2 after it had served its purpose to 
guide the Wise Men to the “new way.” 

(3) The falling star that opened the abyss, according to Revelation 
—a future event, for a change. Out of this well ascends smoke which 
darkens the sun and air, and Franz Boll pointed aptly to the “smoke-

barrel,” south of Sagittarius and Scorpius: Ara, the Altar in the Galaxy, 3 
and under this very Altar arc the souls of the witnesses of God waiting 
for the last day (Rev. vi.9). According to Eratosthenes’ catastcrisms, at 
this Altar Zeus and his followers took their oath before attacking 
Kronos. 4 

The reader is likely to react unkindly claiming that there is no reason 
for whichever connection between legends about the Three Wise Men, 
Revelation, and the “Well of Gilgamesh.” Yet, Franz Boll ( Offenbanmg, 
pp. 69ff.) has recognized in those strange locust demons of Revelation— 
they come out of the well of the abyss—who resemble horses with 
human heads, and have wings, and tails of scorpions, the Sagittarius- 
Centaur of Mesopotamian boundary stones, also to be found on the 
rectangular zodiac of Dendera. Revelation also states that they had 
wreaths as if of gold on their heads: the Egyptian Sagittarius wears a 
double crown, the Teukros tradition ascribes to the constellation “the 
royal face” (to prosopon basilikon, Boll, Sploaera, pp. 18if.). In the 
Gilgamesh Epic Scorpion men watch the way to the other world; Virgil 
(Aeneid 6.286) makes it centaurs. 

We must leave it at that: the chapter “Sagittarius and Saturn” would 
take us too far. We merely wanted to show that Gilgamesh’s well and 
the opening of new ways are not “prehistoric drivel” that has nothing 
to do with our post-Greek, Christian civilization. It was with veritable 
awe that Boll stated ( Offenbanmg , p. 73, n. 4): “Von der Konstanz 
aller wesentlichen Charakteristiken in diesen Sternbildtypen macht sich 
der Fernerstehende schwer einen Begriff.” 

Although all this must remain posterior cura, we would like to men¬ 
tion the suggestion offered by Cornford, namely, “that one of these 
phreata {— wells) in Eleusis was closed at its mouth by the agelastos 
petra i.e., the laughterless rock; Demeter was agelastos because of 
the loss of Persephone, and she was sitting upon this laughterless rock, 

3 Thymiatherion, or thyterion. Michael Scotus still made it “puteus sive sacrarius.” 
See F. Boll, Sphaera (1903), p. 446; Boll, Aus der Offenbanmg Johannis (1914), 
P- 75 - 

4 It remains to be seen whether Ara has something to do with that enigmatical 
well of Gen. xxi.31, 33, called Beer-sheba, which is either “Well of Seven” or “Well 
of the Oath.” The Septuaginta votes for the Oath,” xxi.31: phrear horkismou; 
xxi.33: kai ephyteusen Abraam arouran epi to phreati tou horkou kai epekalesato 
ekei to onoma Kyriou Theos aionios. (Compare also T. Noldeke, “Sieben Brunnen,” 
ARW 7 [1904], pp. 340-44.)

which Cornford (“The Eleusinian Mysteries,” p. 161) proposes to take 
for “the double of the anaklethra at Megara, which, as its name implies, 
was the place where Kore was ‘called up.’ ” This might be, but it does 
not throw much light on the whole plot, whereas it seems important to 
recall how the “laughterless” state of the goddess was altered, namely, 
by the rather improper jokes of Baubo/Iambe. This very trait, now, 
occurs frequently within the scheme of world-ages. The Japanese sun 
goddess, Amaterasu, who, enraged by Susanowo’s misdemeanor, had 
withdrawn into a rocky cave leaving the world in utter darkness, w r as 
caused to come out again only by the lascivious dances of “the ugly 
sky-female,” Uzumue, dancing with the celestial jewol-tree upon her 
head, amidst the 800,000 gods assembled in the Milky Way, and produc¬ 
ing fire afterward. Egyptian Ra, w’ho had retired from a world w’hich 
he did not like anymore, w T as “persuaded” by the same kind of jokes by 
Isis to take up again his duties (“And then the great god laughed at 
her”). The motif emerges again in the Edda , w here Loke and a he-goat 
make the angry Skadi laugh, preventing her, thus, from avenging the 
murder of her father, Thiassi. 5 The story has also survived, although in 
dull disguise, in the Polynesian Marquesas Islands and, in excellent shape, 
wdth the Cherokee Indians; there the sex appeal is missing, admittedly, 
but the agelastos character is xMother Sun, desolate about the death of 
her only daughter: a true Demeter (her daughter resembling Eurydice: 
she had been brought back half of the w r ay already, when the psycho- 
pompoi made a mistake that permitted her to return to Hades); the 
indecent dance is replaced by the concert of a juvenile orchestra. 

We have heard (appendix #29) of an allegedly terrestrial agelastos 
petra with a river flowing at its foot, called Lethe. We also mentioned 
that Eleusis means “Advent,” pointing to the circumstance that Demeter 
arrived there and that, before having borne Zeus, Demeter had the name 
of Rhea (Orph. frg. 145, Kern p. 188). 

The moving of Rhea-Demeter to Eleusis is a huge and perplexing 
story, indeed, involving honeybees, a woodpecker—w T hose daughters 
were promoted to priestesses of Eleusinian Demeter—goats, and w T hat 
else, and w e are not likely to cover this event here and now\ That w T e 
are up to a major change of residence can be taken from the parallel 
case of Amaterasu who, after having been caused by Uzumue’s dance to

leave her cave, was respectfully guided into a “New Hall,” as we hear 
in the Kogo-shui, 6 and “then Ania no Koyane no Mikoto and Futo-tama 
no Mikoto suspended an exalted Sun-rope around this Hall.” 7 

Not being specialists in Eleusinian matters, topography, etc. (they 
remained secrets to the end), we do not feel entitled to deal earnestly 
with these items beyond raising some questions, such as which well was 
closed—if Cornford’s suggestion is right—by the laughterless rock? 
Was it a former lapis manalis? What happened to the agelastos petra 
after Demeter had been moved to laugh? And how could this rock, 
closing a well connected with the underworld, be combined with the 
legends that hold Demeter responsible for the coming into being of the 
Stygian spring (Aelianus, De natura animalium /0.40), or for her having 
caused the waters of Styx to become black (O. Waser, Roscher 4.1572)? 
Demeter is supposed to have changed the color of the Stygian waters 
when she, on her search for Persephone, fleeing from Poseidon and 
changing into a mare, arrived at the Arcadian spring of Styx and per¬ 
ceived in the water her own mis-shape. And how, on the other hand, 
could the bringing into being of Styx and her sitting on the laughter¬ 
less rock be combined with the Orphic claim, according to which 
Demeter “separated the double nourishment of the gods,” splitting it up 
into Nectar and Ambrosia, 8 both of which come out of the “horn of 
Amaltheia,” i.e., alpha Aurigae? 

Considering the amount of testimonies for stones, shards, trees, plugs 
which close the one or the other well, abyss, whirlpool, or, by being 
pulled out or just removed announce major changes and great catastro¬

were, the danger of simplification and of ruthless identifying; to sim¬ 
plify, however, is the very danger that we most wish to avoid. In other 
words, we do not mean to make comparative mythology “easier,” by 
procuring simple denominators upon which all these items could be 
brought; we think, on the contrary, that we are faced with an almost 
uncountable number of x's for which the fitting equations have to be 
worked out in long and cumbersome future investigations. 


Appendix 57 


A sidelight falls upon the notions connected with the stag by Hora- 
pollo’s statement concerning the Egyptian writing of “A long space of 
time: A Stag’s horns grow out each year. A picture of them means a 
long space of time.” 1 Chairemon (hieroglyph no. 15, quoted by 
Tzetzes) made it shorter: “ eniautos: elaphosT Louis Keimer, stressing 
the absence of stags in Egypt, pointed to the Oryx ( Capra Nubiand) 
as the appropriate “ersatz,” 2 whose head was, indeed, used for writing 
the word mp — year, eventually in “the Lord of the Year,” a well- 
known title of Ptah. 3 Rare as this modus of writing the word seems to 
have been—the Worterbuch der Aegyptischen Sprache (eds. Erman 
and Grapow), vol. 2, pp. 429-33, does not even mention this variant— 
it is worth considering (as is every subject dealt with by Keimer), the 
more so as Chairemon 4 continues his list by offering as number 16: 
“ eriiantos: phoinix i.e., a different span of time, the much-discussed 
“Phoenix-period” (ca. 500 years). There are numerous Egyptian words 
for “the year,” and the same goes for other ancient languages. Thus, we

propose to understand eniautos as the particular cycle belonging to the 
respective character under discussion: the mere word eniautos (“in 
itself,” cn hcauto; Plato’s Cratylus 4100) docs not say more than just 
this. It seems unjustifiable to render the word as “ the year” as is done 
regularly now adays, for the simple reason that there is no such thing 
as the year; to begin w ith, there is the tropical year and sidereal year, 
neither of them being of the same length as the Sothic year. Actually, 
the methods of Maya, Chinese, and Indian time reckoning should teach 
us to take much greater care of the w r ords we use. The Indians, for in¬ 
stance, reckoned with five different sorts of “year,” among which one 
of 378 days, for which A. Weber did not have any explanation. 5 That 
number of days, how ever, represents the synodical revolution of Saturn. 
Nothing is gained by the violence with which the Ancient Egyptian 
astronomical system is forced into the presupposed primitive frame. 

The eniautos of the Phoenix would be the said 500 (or 540) years; 
w e do not know yet the stag’s own timetable: his “year” should be 
cither 378 days or 30 years, but there are many more possible periods 
to be considered than w T e dream of—Timaios told us as much. For the 
time being the only important point is to become fully aware of the 
plurality of “years,” and to keep an eye open for more information 
about the particular “year of the stag” (or the Oryx), as well as for 
other eniautoi , especially those occurring in Greek myths which are, 
supposedly, so familiar to us, to mention only the assumed eight years 
of Apollo’s indenture after having slain Python (Plutarch, De defectu 
oraculorwn, ch. 21, 421c), or that “one eternal year (aidion eniauton),” 
said to be “8 years (okto ete), that Cadmus served Ares (Apollod. 5.4.1; 
see also 2.5.11 with long note by Frazer). 


Appendix 38 


See RV /0.46.2, ed. K. Geldner (1951); cf. V. Rydberg, Teutonic 
Mytloologie (1907), p. 587. Geldner, vague as ever, spells it “der 
Gewasser Behausung.” Agni, however, is a title, and the Rigveda stresses 
time and again that three Agnis already have gone away, “consumed”

pp. 281-88, esp. pp. 286-87.

by the “sacrificial service.” Agni, too, is not only coming from the con¬ 
fluence of the rivers like Gibil, but is also born in the “highest sky” 
(RV 6 . 8.2): “Im hochsten Himmel geboren wachte Agni iiber die 
(Opfer) regeln als ihr Hiiter. Der Klugsinnige mass den Luftraum aus.” 
In fact, he has three birthplaces as a rule, in the “three worlds.” (We 
have mentioned already that one of the Agnis had “seven mothers,” 
like Heimdal.) 

But wherever one of the Agnis is “found,” he is a very busy surveyor. 
Says RV 6.7.6: “Durch das Auge des Vaisvanara, durch das Wahr- 
zeichen der Unsterblichkeit sind die Hohen des Himmels ausgemessen. 
Auf seinem Haupte (stehen) alle Welten, wie die Zweige sind seine 
sieben Arme (?) gewachsen.” RV 6.7.1-2 calls the same Agni Vaisvanara, 
“head of the sky, leader 1 of the earth, born at the right time . . . the 
navel of the sacrifice.” Stanza 5 of the same hymn states: “Vaisvanara! 
Diese deine hohen Anforderungen hat noch keiner angetastet, o Agni, 
der du im Schosse der beiden Eltern geboren, das Wahrzeichen in der 
Reihenfolge der Tage fandest.” It is of another Agni, “just born,” “the 
best path-finder,” that RV £.103.11 states: “Der bei (Sonnen-) aufgang 
die angebundenen Schatze erkundet.” Whoever minds the “implex” is 
not going to think of the daily sunrise, if it is the sun at all: this is a 
conjecture of Geldner; we are up either to the heliacal rising of the 
“Agni-in-charge” at the vernal equinox, or at the rising day of Sirius. 
We wonder when the glorious day will finally arrive when the philolo¬ 
gists begin to realize the purely cosmological significance of “sacrifices,” 
and of “victims” chained to a “sacrificial post” or to a mountain. 

The overwhelming amount of evidence on Agni and Soma (“lord of 
the world poles”) as colures will have to be dealt with in the fitting 
frame, by means of an investigation of the so-called Shunashepa Hymns 
of the first Mandala of the Rigi'eda, Shunashepa being literally the same 
as Cynosoura, “Dog’sTail,” i.e., Ursa Minor. In the present context we 
wish to point to only one more name of Agni—being himself a title— 
that is, Apam Napat, a designation which belongs also to Iranian Tish- 
triva, Sirius. Usually it is translated into “child of the waters,” but we 

1 Geldner’s rendering of Sanskrit arati into “Lenker” (Wagenlenker) has been 
contested by P. Thieme (Ulitersuchimgen zur Wortkimde und Ausleginig des 
Rigveda [1949], pp. 26-35). Arati (fern.) from ard , the spoke, being the totality 
of spokes, according to Thieme, he translates RV 6.7.1: “(den Agni), das Haupt 
des Himmels, den Speichenkranz der Erde,” pointing also to 7.59.2: “Agni ist das 
Haupt des Himmels, der Nabel der Erde. So ward er der Speichenkranz der beiden 
Welten.”

cannot agree to this interpretation of napat (whence also Neptunus) 
as “child.” Not only does Boissacq allow only for nephews and nieces 
in connection w ith this radical, but we are always dealing with nephews 
in mythology, beginning with our own hero Amlethus; with Horus, 
nephew of Seth; with Kullervo, nephew of Untamo; with Reynard Fox, 
nephew of Iscngrim; and so forth. What counts is a kind of “broken” 
relation, a subject deserving an extensive chapter, but since the under¬ 
standing of the graphical sign that expresses best this “relation” ( ) 

comes from Maude tradition, West Sudan (where it marks circumcision, 
and the star of circumcision: Sirius), we postpone investigation of the 
whole complex. 

Appendix ^ 

Excursus on Gilgamesh 

There are many points from which to start new trips of exploration 
into the Gilgamesh Epic, once it is conceded that reasonable questions 
have to be asked. Among the many we single out two, without intend¬ 
ing to “get at the bottom of the matter”; the first concerns the “ferry¬ 
man,” the second concerns “trees.” 

Face to face with the ferryman Urshanabi, a kind of personified me 
who was dragged away from the “confluence of the rivers” to check 
the proper measures of Uruk, it can hardly be taken for a farfetched 
idea that we ask for comparative “individuals” or “places” in other 
Mesopotamian texts. There is, indeed, no need for a frantic search: the 
Enuma elish offers us an equally decisive item from which depends the 
whole skeleton map, namely Nibiru (or n eberu). 

There are three passages of the so-called “Babylonian Genesis” that 
give—recognizable at first glance—details of the surveying of the new 
world as accomplished by Marduk/Jupiter. In Speiser’s translation they 
read thus (ANET, pp. 67, 69): 

4. iqiff. He crossed the heavens and surveyed the regions. 

He squared Apsu’s quarter, the abode of Nudimmud [Ea], 
As the lord measured the dimensions of Apsu. 

The Great Abode, its likeness, he fixed as Esharra

y. 1-8 He constructed stations for the great gods, 

Fixing their astral likenesses as constellations. [Heidel: The 
stars, their likeness(es), the signs of the zodiac, he set 
up] 1 

He determined the year by designating the zones: 

He set up three constellations for each of the twelve 
months. 

After defining the days of the year (by means) of (heav¬ 
enly) figures, 

He founded the station of Nebiru to determine their ( heav¬ 
enly) bands, 

That none might transgress or fall short. 

Alongside he set up the stations of Enlil and Ea. 

6.62 f. They raised high the head of Esagila equaling Apsu. 

Having built a stage-tower as high as Apsu, 

They sat in it an abode for Marduk, Enlil (and) Ea. 

Leaving aside the specific charm of these passages—i.e., the circum¬ 
stance that the places of Anu, Enlil, Ea in 4.146, and their stations in 
y.8 are not the same—we concentrate on EE y.6: “He founded the 
station of Nibiru to determine their (heavenly) bands” (Speiser), or: 
“He founded the station of Nibiru to make known their duties” (Hei¬ 
del), or: “Er setzte ein den Nibirupunkt, um festzusetzen ihre Verkno- 
tung” (= riksu; Weidner, Handbnch Babyl. Astr., p. 33), and on y.8: 
“Alongside he set up the stations of Enlil and Ea” (Speiser), or: “He 
established the stations of Enlil and Ea together with it” (Heidel), or: 
“Den Enlilpunkt und den Eapunkt setzte er bei ihm fest” (Weidner). 
That means the position of the “Ways of Anu, Enlil, Ea” was a func¬ 
tion of Nibiru; that only the setting up of the points, or stations, of

F. Kugler ( Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel. [1907-13], vol. 1, p. 259) voted for 
zodiacal signs; E. Weidner ( Reallexikon der Assyriologie [1932], vol. 3, p. 83) con¬ 
fined this signification to the 5th century b.c. and later, whereas O. Neugebauer 
(The Exact Sciences in Antiquity [1962], p. 140) stated that the zodiacal signs 
(instead of constellations) were not yet introduced at 418 b.c. There are texts 
which include among the Lumashi-stars Cygnus, Cepheus, Aquila, Orion, Sirius, 
Centaurus (A. Jeremias, HAOG, p. 200; P. Gossmann, Flanetarium Babylonicum , 
250), and this appears to rule out the zodiac. C. Bezold (Boll-Bezold, Antike 
Beobachtungen farbiger Sterne [1916], p. 149; see also Bezold, Babylonisch-As- 
syrisches Glossar [1926], p. 160) proposed to understand the Lumashi-stars as 
“Jupiter-stars”; this was accepted by B. Meissner ( Babylonien und Assyrien [1932], 
vol. 2, p. 408) but Weidner (RLA 3, p. 80) claimed that Bezold had started from 
erroneous premises.

Knlil and Ea is mentioned suggests that Marduk/Jupiter claims the 
“Anu-ship” for himself. 2 The experts seem to be quite happy with the 
equation “Nibiru = Jupiter” (see below). But what is his “station,” 
or point? Considering that upon this very station of Nibiru rests the 
whole tripartition of the universe during the age ruled by Marduk/ 
Jupiter, it is surprising how little the professionals care. 

The plain meaning of nibiru is “ferry, ferryman, ford”— wikis nibiri 
is the toll one has to pay for crossing the river—from eberu , “to cross.” 3 
Alfred Jcremias insisted that Nibiru “in all star-texts of later times” 
indicated Canopus, taking this star for the provider of the meridian of 
the city of Babylon. 4 There have been other identifications (including 
even a comet!)—the summer solstice, 5 or the celestial North Pole; 6 the 
opinions and verdicts collected by Gossmann ( Vianet ., 311) show clearly 
that Nibiru remains an unknown factor for the time being. 

This deplorable situation is not improved by means of the next occa¬ 
sion, when the ominous word is hurled at us anew, in EE 7.12^., 
where fifty names are given to the new ruler, Marduk/Jupiter, among 
which is Nibiru. 

Speiser translation: 

Nebiru shall hold the crossings of heaven and earth; 

Those who failed of crossing above and below, 

Ever of him shall inquire. 

Nebiru is the star which in the skies is brilliant. 

Verily, he governs their turnings, to him indeed they look 

Saying: “He who the midst of the Sea restlessly crosses, 

Let ‘Crossing’ be his name who controls its midst. 

May they uphold the course of the stars of heaven; 

May he shepherd all the gods like sheep.” 

2 This dignity must have got lost after the first(?) flood (or by means of it?), 
otherwise Marduk could not ask reproachfully for the whereabouts of “Ninigi- 
nangargid, the great carpenter of my Anu-ship” (Era Epic, tabl. /.155; Goss¬ 
mann, Das Era-Epos [1956], p. 98).

eigentlich die Tberfahrtsstelle.’ Der ‘Stern der Uberfahrtsstelle’ ist der Marduk- 
stern Jupiter, wenn er den Meridian iiberschreitet.”

He has taken position at the solstitial point (?), may they look upon 
him,

May he maintain the course of the stars in heaven;

Die Bahn der Sterne des Himmels sollen sie (unverandert) halten... ” 

How secure and unshakable the ground is upon which we walk, 
according to the inscrutable decree of the experts, may be guessed from 
the translation of lines 128-32 by Albrecht Gotze 7 who starts from 
the conviction that eberu — “to bind, to enclose’’ which, combined 
w ith the “solution” that tam-tim means “struggle,” apparently permits 
him to get rid of the “midst of Tiamat” 

Who enclosed (in his net) indeed amidst the struggle without loos¬

gehort zu den sachlich schvderigsten der Tafel, ohne dass der ziemlich 
vollstandig erhaltene Kommentar hierbei w r esentliche Hilfe leistet.” But 
he did not further the case by upholding opinions incompatible among 
themselves since based upon doubtful identifications. On the one hand, 
he claimed Nibiru to be the name given to “the planet and his hyp- 
soma”; on the other hand, he took Nibiru for a star or constellation

marking the point where Jupiter entered the “Way of Anu,” to which 
he adds: “The time of observation is the night of the Vernal Equinox, 
when the Sun stands at the crosspoint of Equator and Ecliptic in the 
constellation Aries.” He does not reveal from where he has this sur¬ 
prising knowledge; he seems to rely on the identification of “ 1 -Iku” 
with Aries/Cctus, which is not the case: the Pegasus-square it is, 9 but 
the constellation is not mentioned in 7.124!!., so what? Apart from this, 
we do not know whether, in the time of the Enuma elish, Aries was 
taken for Jupiter’s hypsoma; there seem to be reasons for recognizing 
—already at this time—Cancer (more precisely: Procyon) = Nangar = 
the Carpenter, as Jupiter’s exaltation. 10 In the third place, if Bohl takes 
1 -Iku for Aries ruling the vernal equinox, how could Jupiter eiiter 
there the “Way of Anu”? 11 The “Way of Anu” represents a band, ac¬ 
companying the equator, reaching from 15 (or 17) degrees north of 
the equator to 15 (or 17) degrees south of it; the “Way of Enlil” runs 
parallel to that of Anu in the North, the “Way of Ea” in the South. 12 
That, due to the precessional shifting of the crossroads of ecliptic and 
equator, the stars standing in these three “Ways” are not the same all 
the time, goes without saying. 

9 Bohl mentions this identification, with reference to Bezold and Schott, p. 211, 
n. 47. 

10 See E. Weidner, “Babylonische Hypsomatabilder,” OLZ 22 (1910), cols. 14EF.; 
Weidner, Gestirn-Darstellungen auf Babylonischen Tontcrfeln (1967), pp. 9b, 134, 
n. 166, and plates V, VI (VAT 7847). A passage from the Taittiriya Brahmana 
(5.1.1) also has to be considered: “When Jupiter was first born, he defeated the 
nakshatra Pushya by his brilliance.” P. Sengupta, who quoted the line in his intro¬ 
duction to Burgess’ translation of the Surya Siddhanta (1935, p. xxxiv), misinter¬ 
preted it thoroughly by claiming it described “the discovery of Jupiter,” and by 
adding, “the star group of Pushya (delta eta gamma Cancri) has no bright stars 
in it and the planet Jupiter was detected when it came near to this star group.” 

To the fully initiated expert who sternly points with outstretched finger to the 
circumstance that the nakshatra Pushya was formerly called Tishya (see, e.g., 
Scherer, Gestirnnamen , p. 150), and that means, Sirius, we can, for the time being, 
only answer that we are aware of this particular circumstance. Premature “solu¬ 
tions” are of no avail. 

11 To be sure, Bohl does not say so explicitly, his wording being as unprecise as 
possible. He claims that at the time of New Year (vernal equinox) “the orbit of 
Jupiter was observed particularly carefully.” “Man beobachtete—so diirfen wir 
annehmen—wie er (wohl von der ausseren Ea-Sphare her [sic!]) in den Anu- 
Bereich eintrat, diesen Bereich durchquerte (eberu, itburu) und ihn dadurch 
gleichsam feierlich in Besitz nahm.”

But, as a matter of fact, “ 1 -Iku,” darkly hinted at by Bohl, does come 
into play, namely, in EE 6.62 , quoted above: “They raised high the 
head of Esagila equaling Apsu .” And concerning this Esagila (or Esagil) 
we hear in the ritual text of the New Year festival in Babylon 13 that 
the Urigallu-priest “shall go out to the Exalted Courtyard, turn to the 
north and bless the temple Esagil three times with the blessing: 4 Ikn-star , 
Esagil , image of heaven and earth ” “ 1 -Iku,” the Pegasus-square (= al¬ 
pha beta gamma Pegasi, alpha Andromedae) is, indeed, of the utmost 
importance, 1 -Iku representing the fundamental field measure, 14 and 
Ungnad (Das voiedergefundene Paradies [1923], p. 11) understood the 
constellation, enclosed by Pisces, for the “Paradise,” the primordial field, 
so to speak. More important, Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh (GE 77.57) 
about his ark, which was, like the apsu, an exact cube: “One iku was 
its floor space.” 15 (Before, 77.31, Ea had ordered Utnapishtim: “Like the 
apsu thou shalt ceil her.”) Remembering what we heard above: “Since 
the ark disappeared there was a stone in its place . . . which was called 
foundation stone,” i.e., Eben Shetiyyah, that covered the abyss, this 
cubic ark, the floor space of which was one iku, cannot be without 
interest for us, the less so, when the gods “raised high the head of 
Esagila (= 1 -Iku) equaling Apsu.” 

To be sure, this does not teach us where Marduk was supposed to be 
when he received the title Nibiru—it might have been decisive for the 
planet to rise heliacally together with 1 -Iku, the celestial model of Esa¬ 
gil (representing the “foundation-stone-covering-the-apsu,” maybe?), 
but when? 16 The heliacal rising of “ 1 -Iku”—precisely, beta Pegasi—

16 One clue, at least (probably many more), to the situation is contained in the 
Cuneiform Tablet K 3476 dealing with the Babylonian New Year festival, trans¬ 
lated and commented on by Heinrich Zimmern (“Zum babylonischen Neujahrs- 
fest,” BVSGW $8 [1906] 5, pp. 127-36), which says that “Marduk lies with 
his feet within Ea” (lines 20-21: “(Das ist) Marduk [ . . . ] [der (?) mit (?)1 
seinen Fiissen innerhalb (?) Eas liegt”). In a note, Zimmern proposes to under¬ 
stand this line as an “allusion to a constellation connected with Marduk (Auriga?) 
that reaches into a constellation connected with Ea (Aries?).” S. A. Pallis, not 
tending to astronomical notions, made it that “Marduk lies (?) before (?) 
Ea”; the unmistakable presence of the planet Venus in the second part of the 
sentence ( kakkabu DIL. BAT) forced him to the concession: “perhaps it refers to 
certain astronomical conditions” (The Babylonian Akitu Festival [1926], p. 217). 
In 1926, sufficient literature about the “Three Ways” was available.

coincided with the winter solstice of 4000 b.c.; around 1000 b.c. it took 
place on January 25. 17 “ 1 -Iku,” the Pegasus-square, is called “the habita¬ 
tion of the deity Ea, the leader of the stars of Anu” 18 in the “Series 
mu, APIN” (Plow-star, Triangulum), called by Weidner “a Babylo¬ 
nian compendium of astronomy.” 19 According to van der Waerden 
(“The Thirty-Six Stars,” p. 17) this series is a compilation “made about 
700 b.c. or somewhat earlier 20 —in which material from different periods 
between -1400 and -700 was used”: thus, 1 -Iku as “leader” of the stars 
standing in the “Way of Anu” would rise in the end of January, quite 
a time away from the vernal equinox when the New Year’s festival was 
held. 

This is all very nice so far, and certainly not without highest interest, 
but do we know meanwhile what Nibiru, “ferry, ferryman, ford,” was 
supposed to be? Even without worrying about Jupiter and his where¬ 
abouts? We know it not, and we feel tempted to say: “quod erat 
demonstrandum,” namely, that the many verbose translations, eloquent 
articles, and books have not cleared up the decisive points of the cos¬ 
mological system ruling the Enuma elish, the Gilgamesh Epic, the Era 
Epic and the other alleged “poems.” Nibiru is only one case among 
many, but it is a rather significant model case for proving that no con¬ 
crete problem is going to be solved as long as the experts of astronomy 
are too supercilious to touch “mythical” ideas—which are firmly be¬ 
lieved to be plain nonsense, of course—as long as historians of religion 
swear to it that stars and planets were smuggled into originally “healthy” 
fertility cults and naive fairy tales only “very late”—whence these un¬ 
healthy subjects should be neglected by principle—and as long as the 
philologists imagine that familiarity with grammar replaces that scien¬ 
tific knowledge which they lack, and dislike. 

But even when the different specialists would condescend to renounce 
their common haughtiness, we do not think that there is much chance 
to arrive at a satisfying solution of concrete details, and the adequate 
understanding of the system as a whole, without taking into account 
comparable systems of other parts of the earth: Mesopotamia is by no 
means the only province of high culture where the astronomers worked

with a tripartition of the sphere—even apart from the notion allegedly 
most familiar to us, in reality most unknown—that of the “Ways” of 
Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades as given by Homer. The Indians have a very 
similar scheme of dividing the sky into Ways 21 (they even call them 
“ways”). And so have the Polynesians, who tell us many details about 
the stars belonging to the three zones (and by which planet they were 
“begotten”); but nobody has thought it worth listening to the greatest 
navigators our globe has ever seen; nor has any ethnologist of our 
progressive times thought it worth mentioning that the Polynesian 
megalithic “sanctuaries” (maraes) gained their imposing state of “holi¬ 
ness” (taboo) when the “Unu-boards” were present, these carved Unu- 
boards representing “the Pillars of Rumia,” Rumia being comparable to 
the “Way of Anu,” where Antares served as “pillar of entrance” (among 
the other “pillars”: Aldebaran, Spica, Arcturus, Phaethon in Columba). 

But now, is Nibiru as important as all that? We think so. Or, to say 
it the other way around: once this astronomical term, and two or three 
more, are reliably settled, one can begin in earnest to get wise to, and 
to translate, Mesopotamian “poetry.”

The epics of Gilgamesh and Era offer too many trees for our modest 
demands. The several wooden individuals have, however, the one ad¬ 
vantage that the expert’s delight in uttering deep words about “the 
world-tree” wilts away. 

There is, first, the mesh-tree, contained in the hero’s name, 22 about the 
location of which Marduk asks stern questions of Era, followed by the 
cedar of Huwawa/Humbaba which was—as we have been taught by 

21 See W. Kirfel, Die Kosmographie der Inder nacl: den Quellen dargestellt 
(1920), pp. 140b At first glance, it looks as if only" the circle of lunar mansions 
was subdivided into these three ways, but the domains are extended far bey’ond 
the limits of the “inhabited world” in both directions, north and south, as are the 
Ways of Enlil and Ea. 

22 The idenuty of the tree is not settled. R. Labat (Manuel d'Epigraphie Akka- 
dienne [1963], no. 314) proposes “ cedre (rmicocoulier?) [ Celtis australis , “ge- 
meiner Ziirgelbaum”— Celtis occidentalis is the American nettle tree] ^LMEZ-MA- 
GAN-(NA) musskanu-murier (rmicocoulier de Magan?)” (Cf. Labat, no. 296: 
“GIS, bois, arbre. Determinatif prccedant les noms d’arbres et d’objets en bois.”)

(Even this mes-wood from Magan cannot be dismissed as “not applicable” for 
the GE, because in the Sumerian myth “Gilgamesh and the Land of the Living ’

the specialists—felled by Gilgamesh and Enkidu. Yet, according to the 
“latest news” available to us, 23 Huwawa is “the guardian monster of the 
‘land of the cut cedar.’ ” Admittedly, also at an earlier occasion, Kramer 
stressed his opinion that “the far distant ‘Land of the Living’ was also 
the ‘Land of the Felled Cedar,’ ” 24 but we have not yet found evidence 
of any thought, any consequence which should follow such alarming 
statements. But one cannot expect earnest thoughts to be wasted on 
Sumerian conceptions from a scholar who wrote about the fathers of 
hydraulic engineering (irrigation) that “to the Sumerian poets and 
priests the real sources of the Tigris and Euphrates in the mountains of 
Armenia were of little significance. They did not understand, as we do, 
that the volume of the waters of the two rivers depended upon ‘feeding’ 
from their tributaries, or that it was the melting winter snows which 
produced the annual overflow, or that the Tigris and Euphrates ‘emp¬ 
tied’ their swollen waters into the Persian Gulf. Indeed, their view was 


not to shrink away from Humbaba, Gilgamesh utters the most enigmatical words: 
“Do thou help me [and] I will help thee, what can happen to us? After it had 
sunk, after it had sunk, After the Magan-boat had sunk, After the boat ‘the might 
of Alagilum’ had sunk.”) 

See also F. Hommel, Ethnologie und Geographic des Alten Orients (1926), pp. 
539> 783. According to Meissner, quoted by Weidner (“Gestirn-Darstellungen auf 
Babylonischen Tontafeln,” SOAW 254 [1967], p. 18), gis MES = mesu is the rowan. 
As concerns the astrological system of connecting trees (and stones, and animals, 
etc.) with the zodiac, the tablets translated by Weidner put the mes-tree two times 
with Aquarius (pp. 18, 35), once with Aries (p. 31). Wood of the mesu-tree and of 
the huluppu-tree occurs as building material for the chariot ( narkabtu ) of Ningirsu, 
in the Gudea Cylinder A VII, 16-18 (cf. A. Salonen, Prozessionswagen [1946], 
p. 6; Salonen, Die Landfahrzeuge des Alten Mesopotamien [1951], pp. inf.). 

This tree is also part of the name of MES.LAM.TA.E 3 .A, taken for the oldest 
name known of the god Nergal (see J. Bollenrucher, Gebete und Hymnen an 
Nergal [1904], p. 7) and the name of the one of the Gemini, MES.LAALTA.E.A., 
means “who comes forth from MES.LAM.” MES.LAAl was the name given to 
Nergal’s sanctuary in Kutha, and means “the luxuriantly growing MES-tree,” 
according to Gossmann (Das Era-Epos, p. 67), who continues with respect to the 
name MES.LAM.TA.E.A.: “Spater diente der Name in erster Linie als Bezeich- 
nung eines der beiden Zwillinge ( Planetarium Babylonicum , 271), bezw. als Tum- 
melplatz philologischer Spielereien. Auf Grund solcher Philologeme wurde der 
Name auf Marduk und Gilgamesh iibertragen (Tallqvist, 374).” It is not in the 
best scientific style to dispose of difficult formulae by declaring them philological 
pastimes. Since MES.LAM appears to be a “fixed” topos, we can hardly expect 
that “to come forth from MES.LAM” has been a monopoly of Nergal-Mars. But

far distant Land of the Living (also known as cedar land).”

just the opposite; it was the Persian Gulf which was responsible for 
the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates and for their all-important over¬ 
flow. Mythologically expressed, it was Enki who filled the Tigris and 
Euphrates with sparkling water, and who, by riding the sea, makes its 
waters and those of the Tigris and Euphrates, turbulent and violent 
... In short, as the Sumerians saw it, it was not the rivers that 'fed' the 
sea,.. . but rather the sea that 'fed' the rivers.” 25 

Apart from the mes-tree and the unexplained cedar of Huwawa/ 
Humbaba—whether it was felled by our heroes or not—the Gilgamesh 
Epic confronts us with the huluppu- tree, taken for a willow by Labat 
(nos. 371, 589), for an oak by the Assyrian Dictionary (vol. 6 , pp. 55E), 
for a kind of Persea by Salonen ( Landfahrzeuge , pp. 11 if.)—all the 
identifications decently equipped with a question mark. This specimen 
crosses our way in the Sumerian version of the Gilgamesh Epic, part 
of which was incorporated as Tablet XII in the Akkadian Epic; the 
Sumerian text has been translated by C. J. Gadd, 26 and by S. X. Kramer. 27 
We quote the summary given by Kramer in his first translation (1938, 
p. 12) for the simple reason that it is shorter than the one offered in 
JAOS 64 (1944), pp. 19-21. In the meantime, this text had been given 
a different name, i.e., '‘Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the X'etner World.” The 
first half of the first sentence is, of course, no quotation, and it is not 
likely to be subscribed to by the author. 

On occasion of a new distribution of the "Three Ways,” 28 "on that 
day,” it happened that "a huluppu tree (very likely a willow) which 
had been planted on the bank of the Euphrates and nourished by its 
waters was uprooted by the South Wind and carried off by the Eu¬ 
phrates. A goddess wandering along the bank seized the floating tree,

the identification of this "Land of the Living*’ with Dilmun, as claimed in this 
article, and as upheld in all later publications.

25 As concerns the beginning of this text, one shock after the other receives the 
reader who studies eagerly the various "translations”: it is hard to believe that they 
are meant to render the same Sumerian original. Out of the first lines Kramer 
(Sumerian Mythology, pp. 30ft.) built up the Sumerian creation story which he 
took (and takes?) for unknown; in JAOS 64, p. 19, he stressed again: "The first 
thirteen lines of this passage contain some of our basic data for the analysis of the 
Sumerian concept of the creation of the universe.” Of the follo%ving lines 14-25 
he constructed a dragon-fight. By means of hitherto unpublished pieces, Kramer 
claimed, in 1958 ( Gilgamesh et sa legende, p. 66), that “the first seven lines of the

and at the word of Anu and Enlil she brought it to Inanna’s [i.c., Ish- 
tar’s] garden in Uruk. Inanna tended the tree carefully and lovingly, 
hoping to have made of its wood a throne and bed for herself. After 
ten years had passed and the tree had matured, Inanna, to her chagrin, 
found herself unable to realize her hopes. For in the meantime a dragon 
had set up its nest at the base of the tree, the Zu-bird had placed his 
young in its crown, and in its midst the demoness Lilith had built her 
house. But Gilgamesh, informed of Inanna’s distress, rushed to her aid. 
Making light of his weighty armor, the giant slew the dragon with his 
huge bronze ax, seven talents and seven minas in weight. Thereupon 
the Zu-bird fled with his young to the mountain, while Lilith, terror- 
stricken, tore down her house and escaped to the desert. After Gilga¬ 
mesh had uprooted the liberated tree, his followers, the men of Uruk, 
cut down its trunk and gave part of it to Inanna for her throne and bed. 
Of the remainder—i.e., root and crown—“Gilgamesh makes for himself 
the pulcku and mikku, two wooden objects of magic significance.” 


poem can now be completely restored.” He added, however: “Unfortunately, the 
meaning of the passage is by no means certain and the mythological implications 
are rather obscure, as is obvious from the following tentative translation: 

The days of creation, the distant days of creation, 

The nights of creation, the far-off nights of creation, 

The years of creation, the distant years of creation,— 

After in (?) days of yore everything needful had been brought into existence, 
After in (?) days of yore everything needful had been commanded, 

After in the shrines (?) of the land bread (?) had been tasted (?) 

After in the ovens of the land, bread (?) had been baked (?).” 

Nobody is likely to contradict the stated uncertainty of the meaning; it would 
be advisable to mind the utterance of Margarete Riemschneider (Augengott und 
Heilige Hochzeit [1953], p. 190): “So lange sie sinnlos sind, stimmen unsere Uber- 
setzungen nicht.” The objections raised by stern expert reviewers (T. Jacobsen, 
“Sumerian Mythology,” JNES $ [1946], pp. 128-52; M. Witzel, “Zur sumerischen 
Mythologie,” Or. 77 [1948], pp. 393-415) remain throughout within the usual frame 
of specialists on grammar and “religion,” and it is hard to decide who carries off 
the laurels in this race of arbitrary interpretations. The remarkable point of the 
new “distribution” seems to be that Ereshkigal belongs henceforward to the “nether 
world.” (In 1938 Kramer translated line 12: “After Ereshkigal had been presented 
(?) as a gift (?) to (?) the netherworld”; in his Sumerian Mythology , after having 
“discovered” the dragon-fight, he made it: “After Ereshkigal had been carried off 
into Kur as its prize.” Witzel (Or. 77, p. 402) rendered the line: “Als (der) 
Ereshkigal mit der Unterwelt Geschenk ‘aufgewartet’ worden war.”) Since we do 
not know yet which star or constellation Ereskigal was meant to represent, this 
does not tell us more than that the (unknown) asterism had “entered” the Way of 
Ea, i.e., that it had sunk below the 15th (or 17th) degree of southern latitude.

(It goes without saying that there is no whiff of “magic significance’’ 
to be found in the text.) Here, the summary of 1938 comes to its end, 
and we continue with JAOS 64 , p. 20: “Follows a passage of twelve 
lines which describes Gilgamesh’s activity in Erech with this pukku and 
mikku, with this ‘drum’ and ‘drumstick’ [see below]. Despite the fact 
that the text is in perfect condition, it is still impossible to penetrate its 
meaning. It is not improbable, however, that it describes in some detail 
the overbearing and tyrannical acts which, according to the first tablet 
of the Epic of Gilgamesh, brought woe to the inhabitants of Erech, and 
which, again according to the Babylonian epic only, led to the creation 
of Enkidu.” 

According to this verdict, Kramer does not even try to translate lit¬ 
erally the lines 24-35 which are allegedly in “perfect condition.” Gadd 
(RA 50, p. 131) renders the passage as follows: 

22. He makes its root into his pukku [ gis RIM (ellag) ] 

23. Its top he makes into his mikku [ gis E.AG] 

24. He says “ellag,” except (?) “ellag” let him not speak

31. The Wine (?) was taken away [ d gestin-an-na] 

32. (In) his place where the pukku was set he draws a circle

34. In the morning his place where the circle was drawn he viewed 

35. The adults (?) do not. . . 

36. (But) at the crying of a little girl . . . 

Kramer continues: “When the story becomes intelligible once again, 
it continues with the statement that ‘because of the outcry of the young 
maidens,’ the pukku and mikku fell into the nether world. Gilgamesh 
put in his hand as well as his foot to retrieve them, but was unable to 
reach them. And so he seats himself at the gate of the nether world and 
laments: 

O my pukku, O my mikku. 

My pukku whose lustiness was irresistible, 

My mikku whose pulsations could not be drowned out. 29 

29 In From the Tablets of Sumer (1956), p. 224, Kramer translated: “My pukku 
with lustiness irresistible, My mikku with dance-rhythm unrivaled.” 



Hamlet’s Mill • 442 

(With the following line, representing line 1 of Tablet XII, the Ak¬ 
kadian translation sets in): 30 

In those days when verily my pukku was with me in the house of the 
carpenter, 31 

(When) verily the wife of the carpenter was with me like the mother 
who gave birth to me 

(When) verily the daughter of the carpenter was with me like my 
younger sister, 

My pukku, who will bring it up from the nether world, 

My mikku, who will bring it up from the “face” of the netherworld? 

His servant Enkidu, his constant follower and companion, thereupon 
volunteers to descend to the nether world and bring them up for him 
... Hearing his servant’s generous offer, Gilgamesh warns him of a num¬ 
ber of the nether world tabus which he is to guard against . . . But 
Enkidu heeds not the instructions of his master and commits all those 
very acts against which Gilgamesh has warned him. And so he is seized 
by Kur and is unable to reascend to the earth.” 

We can do, here, without the following description of the goings-on 
in the “underworld,” a description which is common to the Sumerian 
myth of the huluppu-tree, and to Tablet XII of the Akkadian Epic. 
Kramer (JAOS 64, p. 23) closes his inquiry on the Sumerian sources 
of the Gilgamesh Epic: “In conclusion, a comparison of the text of the 
‘twelfth’ tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh with that of our Sumerian 
poem Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Nether World, proves beyond all 
doubt what has long been suspected, that is, that the ‘twelfth’ tablet is 
an inorganic appendage attached to the Babylonian epic whose first 
eleven tablets constitute a reasonably well-integrated poetic unit.” We 
do wish neither to consent nor to disagree; we do not like those “beyond 
all doubt’s,” and similar verdicts, considering how frightfully little we 
know of the Epic. (If there is something that is, really, “beyond all 
doubt,” it is only this, that the eleven tablets of the Epic do not “con- 

30 Thus, directly after Urshanabi’s checking of the measures of Uruk (//.307), 
there follows as catchline line 308 = 12.1: “In those days, when ...” 

31 A. Heidel (p. 95) translates lines 1-3: “O that today I had left the pukku in 
the house of the carpenter! O that I had left it with the wife of the carpenter, who 
was to me like the mother who bore me! O that I left it with the daughter of the 
carpenter, who was to me (like) my younger sister.” In a footnote he explains: 
“Had Gilgamesh left his pukku and his mikku in the house of the carpenter, they 
would have been safe and would not have fallen into the underworld.” He adds: 
“The translation of the first three lines is somewhat tentative.” Of only the first 
three lines?

stitute a reasonably well-integrated poetic unit,” not the translated 
Epic.) 

Of course, it would be to our great advantage were we to know 
more about the objects “pukku” and “mikku,” that have withstood the 
honest efforts of several scholars, first among whom is Sidney Smith 
(“b/pukk/qqu and mekku,” RA 30 [1933], pp. 153-68). Nets have been 
proposed, wind instruments (pipes and horns), and iMargarete Riem- 
schneider ( Augengott, pp. 5of.) voted for a particular trap, the very 
same rather uncanny trap which is known to us from the Pyramid Texts 
(representing the “palace” of Upper Egypt). Most interpreters have 
accepted Landsberger’s first proposition “drum” and “drumstick”; 32 
there is nothing to say against this solution per se , as long as the signifi¬ 
cance of celestial drums is recognized (see chapter VIII, “Shamans and 
Smiths”), and under the condition that comparable celestial drums are 
properly investigated—e.g., those of the Chinese sphere. For the time 
being there is no cogent reason to stick to “drum” and “drumstick,” 
the less so as Landsberger dropped his earlier notion—about which he 
states explicitly that he never substantiated it—for the sake of “hoop” 
and “driving stick.” 33 In the present situation, however, we know 
nothing of the function of pukku and mikku, and this fact should pre¬ 
vent idle speculations. 

No less lamentable than the loss of these objects is the circumstance 
that we do not know more about Inanna’s unwelcome subtenants in her 
huluppu-tree, about Lilith, and about the dragon at the root; that he 
corresponds to Nidhoggr of the Edda does not enlighten us concerning 
his identity. The Zu-bird, at least, is known to us: the planet Mars it is, 34 
but we do not yet risk drawing specific conclusions from this ideritifica- 

32 Marius Schneider votes for “drum” (Rahmentrommel) and “harp” or “lyre,” 
in his article “Pukku und Mikku. Ein Beitrag zum Aufbau und zum System der 
Zahlenmystik des Gilgamesh-Epos,” Antaios 9 (1967), pp. 28of. 

33 “Einige unerkannt gebliebene oder verkannte Nomina des Akkadischen,” 
WZKM 5 6 (i960), pp. 124-26. It is advisable to take into consideration that Lands¬ 
berger does not recognize the occurrence of the word pukku in GE /.II.22, be¬ 
cause Schott and Schmoekel brought the alleged drum pukku into the first tablet 
of their translations without hesitating. At first glance, it might seem irrelevant 
whether or not pukku occurs in the first tablet. A little concentrated thinking will 
correct this impression: pukku having been made from the wood of the felled 
huluppu-tree, the whole timetable of the Epic, particularly the appropriate alloca¬ 
tion of the 12th tablet and the Sumerian poem of the huluppu-tree, might hinge 
upon the valid answer to this very question: whether or not pukku does make its 
appearance in the first tablet.

tion to the “nest” or “house” of the planet that was taken away from 
him. 

The deadlock is hardly to be overcome by Mesopotamian texts alone, 
and this goes for the huluppu-trcc, the mes-trec, Huwawa’s cedar, and 
that tree in the lira Epic of which Era announces (Tablet 4.123-26, 
Gbssmann, pp. 3of.; Langdon, MAR 5, p. 144): “Irkalla will I shake 
and the heavens shall tremble. The brilliancy of Jupiter [ il SUL.PA.E 3 ] 
will I cause to fall and the stars will 1 suppress. 35 The root of the tree 
w ill I tear up and its sprout will not thrive.” 

In ease we wushed to go on this errand in the future we should start 
from tw r o Indian nakshatras (lunar mansions) and the legends connected 
with them: mula (or mura ), “the root,” also called “the tearer out of 
the root” (see also appendices #4 and #30), and even “Yama’s two un¬ 
fasteners,” i.e., the Sting of Scorpius, 36 (lambda upsilon Scorpii)—in 
Babylonian astronomy mul SAR.UR and mul SAR.GAZ, the weapons of 
Marduk in the “battle” against Tiamat; and the iiakshatra containing 
Antares (alpha Scorpii) which bears the names “the oldest,” or “who 
slays the oldest” 37 —in Tahiti: “parent pillar of the world.” 

From India w T e should turn to the hero Tahaki of Tuamotuan texts, 38 
already mentioned, because he represents the almost “professional” 
avenger of his father. Right from the beginning of events, Tahaki’s 
mother laments that the hero is destined to die in a faraway country, 

35 Langdon (AIAR 5, pp. 144!’.) points to the prophecy against Babylon and its 
king, in Isa. xm, xiv, “clearly reminiscent of this passage ... ‘I will make the 
heavens to tremble and the earth shall be shaken out of her place.’ So prophesied 
the Hebrew writer, and even more obvious is his borrowing from the Irra myth 
when he compares the king of Babylon to Helel: ‘How art thou fallen from 
Heaven, O Helel, son of morning!’ In the cuneiform text of the Irra myth Marduk 
is called Shulpae, the name of Jupiter in the early morning, and there can be little 
doubt that Helel is a transcription of a Babylonian title of Marduk-Jupiter, elil, 
‘the shining one.’ ” 

36 The Indians claim that exactly opposite to iniila was Betelgeuse, ruled by 
“Rudra-the-destroying-archer,” whereas the Coptic list of lunar mansions (Kircher, 
Oedipus Aegyptiacus 2 [1653], pt. 2, p. 246) calls the Sting of Scorpius (al-Sha’ula) 
“Soleka statio translationis caniculae in coelum . . . unde et Siot vocatur, statio 
venationis,” which is of the utmost importance since it elucidates the role of a 
“sea-star” common to Sirius and the Scorpion-goddess.

pp. 291 f.) renders JyesthaghnI: “die altesten (Geschwister) todtend” which re¬ 
minds us, nolens volens, of Mercer, who translates Pyramid text 399 ab: “It is N. 
who judges with him whose name is hidden (on) this day of slaying the eldest 
(gods), and N. is lord of offerings, who knots the cord.”

and again and again throughout the unfolding of the legend, Tahaki 
sings: “I go to the night-realm of Kiho, the last bourne of repose.” 
When still a child, his cousin, with whom he plays diving for pearls, 
kills and dismembers him; but his foster brother saves the vital parts 
(unlike the case of Osiris), from which his mother revives him again. 
He sets out with this brother to free his father from the “goblin 
myriads” (see above, p. 175). When reaching the home of his grand¬ 
parents, he wins the love of Hapai, daughter of Tane, the Deus Faber. 
When Hapai tells her father about the young man, he answers: “If he 
is really Tahaki go and say to him: ‘Tane-of-ancient-waters told me 
that if you can pass before his face you must be Tahaki; if you can sit 
upon his four-legged stool, you must be Tahaki; if you can pull up his 
sacred tree by the roots then you are surely Tahaki.’ Then Tahaki went 
to Tane-of-ancient-waters and stood beside him; and immediately he 
passed before his face; he sat upon his high four-legged stool—and it 
broke to pieces under him; then Tahaki pulled up his sacred tree by the 
roots—and Tahaki looked down and saw the entrance to Havaiki 
beneath. 39 Then Tahaki and Tane-of-ancient-waters chanted a song 
about the death of Tahaki.” 40 Nonetheless, with Tane’s consent, the pair 

39 Compare Handy, on Marquesas (Bull. BPB Mus. 69, p. 132): “When Vaka-Uhi 
had reached a certain spot in the sea, he could see Havaiki down at the bottom 
of the ocean.” We seem to be still circling the spot beneath the whirlpool, de¬ 
scribed by Adam of Bremen, and by the Cherokee (see pp. io6f.). 

40 Stimson, p. 73. The antiphony of the chant does not allow for a summary: 
there are “First Voice,” “Second Voice,” “Chorus,” “Refrains” sung by Tane, and 
Tahaki gets some lines in between, also. Noteworthy is the mentioning of a “way- 
opener,” but we do not know who he is, the Polynesians being more prone to 
“titles” and kenningar than other mythographers. Sung by (a) Tahaki, (b) the 
first voice, (c) the second voice, we hear (a) “It was Puga-ariki-tahi-”; (b) “The 
first Puga-ariki who came at last”; (c) “To Fare-kura- templed abode of the vener¬ 
ated learning of the gods—there in the spirit-world where thou dwellest.” This 
Fare-kura (fare = house, kura — red, or purple; Maori: Whare kura; Samoa: Fale 
ula, etc.) was, according to the “Lore of the Whare-wananga” of New Zealand, a 
temple “at Te Hono-i-wairua ... in the spot where the teaching of the Whare- 
wananga originated” (i.e., remarks S. Smith, p. 82, “where man was first taught 
the doctrines brought down from Heaven by Tane”). The Te Hono-i-wairua (the 
gathering place of the spirits) was in Hawaiki, the so-called “primordial home” 
of the Polynesians, and the sage states (Smith, p. 101): “Whakaahu, a star ( Castor , 
in the constellation Gemini) was appointed (or set up) at Te Hono-i-wairua in 
Hawaiki . . . whilst Puanga (Rigel of Orion) was fixed at the east of Rarohenga 
(Hades).” Later he explains (p. 113) that “those spirits which by their evil con¬ 
duct on this earth . . . left the temple [Whare kura] by the Takeke-roa (or long 
rapid, descent) to Rarohenga, or Hades,” while the others ascended slowly to the 
“realm of Io the Supreme God,” i.e., the same as Kiho-tumu, Kiho-the-All-Source, 
of Tuamotu. 




Hamlet’s Mill • 446 

still lived together “many months until a certain day when trouble arose 
between them ... So Tahaki went far far away to a distant land hop¬ 
ing that he might be killed there. And the land where Tahaki was slain 
at last was known as Harbor-of-refreshing-rain.” 

After an extended excursion into Mexico and the “broken tree,” the 
symbol of Tamoanchan , “the house of descending,” where the gods 
were hurled down for having plucked the forbidden flowers, the broken 
tree being claimed to be the Milky Way (W. Krickeberg, “Der mittel- 
amerikanische Ballspielplatz und seine religiose Symbolik,” Paideuma 5 
[1944-49], p. 132), we should return once more to the storehouse of 
magnificent survivals, Finland, particularly to the many variants of the 
“cutting of the large oak” (K. Krohn, FFC J2 [1924], pp. 183-99). 
This was by no means an easy task to accomplish, but the oak had made 
trouble right from the start. When (in the second rune of the Kalevala) 
Sampsii Pellervoinen had sowed trees, it was the oak alone that would 
not grow until four or five lovely maidens from the water, and a hero 
from the ocean, had cleared the ground with fire and planted an acorn 
in the ashes; and once it had started, the growth of the tree could not 
be stopped: 


And the summit rose to heaven 
And its leaves in air expanded, 

In their course the clouds it hindered , 

And the driving clouds impeded, 

And it hid the shining sunlight , 

And the gleaming of the moonlight . 

Then the aged Vainamoinen, 

Po?idered deeply and reflected, 

“Is there none to fell the oak-tree , 

And overthrow the tree vtajestic? 

Sad is now the life of mortals, 

And for fish to swim is dismal , 

Since the air is void of sunlight, 

And the gleaming of the moonlight .” 

“One sought above in the sky, below in the lap of the earth,” as we 
are informed by variants, but then Vainamoinen asked his divine mother 
for help. 




447 * Appendices 

Then a man arose from ocean 
From the waves a hero started, 

Not the hugest of the hugest, 

Not the smallest of the smallest . 

As a man's thumb was his stature; 

Lofty as the span of wo?nan. 

The “puny man from the ocean,” whose “hair reached down to his 
heels, the beard to his knees,” announces, “I have come to fell the oak 
tree/And to splinter it to fragments.” And so he does. In several variants 
the oak is said to have fallen over the Northland River, so as to form the 
bridge into the abode of the dead. Holmberg (quoted by Lauri Honko, 
“Finnen,” Wb. Myth., p. 369) took the oak for the Milky Way. 

Considering that the same puny character was alone able to kill the 
huge ox—we might call it “bull” quietly—whose mere sight chased all 
heroes to the highest trees, we can hardly overlook the possibility that 
we are up to some kind of “grandson” of hairy Enkidu, and the oak 
would be a faint reflection of the cedar. Whereas an Esthonian variant 
sounds—although suffering from atrophy—more like the story of the 
huluppu-tree. A damsel plants the acorn—it is typical that Krohn 
(p. 187) calls the versions of Russian Karelia “disfigured,” where this 
acorn is called “taivon tahti,” i.e., sky-star—the growing tree endangers 
the sky, trying to “tear the celestial luminaries, or to darken them.” 
The maiden, therefore, asks her brother to cut off the tree. Out of its 
wood presents are made for the relatives of the bridegroom, and for 
the virgin herself a chest is fabricated. 

Since we do not mean to undertake the expedition into comparative 
tree-lore here and now, we have to leave it at that. That mythical 
“trees” are not of terrestrial provenance, and that we cannot cope with 
the different specific tree individuals under the heading “the world 
tree”—not although , but because they are “cosmic” trees—could have 
been expected by everybody who has spent time and thought on 
the tree of the Cross; on Yggdrasil (and Ashvatta); on the “Saltwater- 
tree” of the Cuna Indians; on Zeus’ oak, part of which was built into 
Argo; on the fig tree at the vortex which saved Odysseus; on the laurel 
which did not yet mark the omphalos of Delphi, when Apollo slew 
Python (“nondum laurus erat,” Ovid)—it had to be brought from 
Tempe after Apollo’s indenture of eight great years; on Uller’s yew-tree 
(belonging to Sirius) by means of whose juice Hamlet’s father was

murdered; on—apart from the mentioned Mesopotamian tree individ¬ 
uals—the “dark kishkannu-trcc” growing in Eridu, where no mortal is 
ever admitted; on the tamarisk at Be’ersheba in Genesis xxi; on the 
heather tree that “enfolded and embraced the chest with its growth and 
concealed it within its trunk,” the “chest” being the coffin of Osiris 
(Plutarch, De hide et Osiride , eh. 14-15, 356E-357A); and on the king of 
the country who “cut off the portion that enfolded the chest, and used 
it as pillar to support the roof of his house,” until Isis carried off this 
“pillar.” Those who prefer to overlook these items (and very many 
more) might recall the many times that we hear of much sighing and 
crying over trees cut down, sawed in two, and the like 41 —after all, our 
very Yima-Jamshid was sawed in two, by Azhi Dahak—as Tammuz 
“the lord of the great tree, overcome by the rage of his enemies,” and 
the numerous comparisons of Mesopotamian temples with trees (cf. 
M. Witzel, Texte zuvi Studium Sumerischer Tempel mid Kidtzentren 
[1932], pp. 37 f.; Witzel, Tammuz-Liturgien mid Verzvandtes [1935], 
pp. io8f.). 

It would be an imposition to expect the reader to listen to such 
endless rambling on without telling him the aim that we hope to attain, 
sooner or later, by digging into these trees and posts: we do want to 
know which “New Way” it was that has been “opened” by Gilgamesh 
who was “wood” from the mes-tree, and we wish to find out the chrono¬ 
logical sequence of the celestial events as told in the Enuma elish, the 
Gilgamesh Epic and the Era Epic. The irrelevancy of the scholarly 
quest for “poets” (and who cribbed from whom) has been understood, 
meanwhile: it is the celestial phenomena that move and change, and not 
the “mythopoetic fantasy” or the “doctrines” of poets and pontiffs. 
We have to find out, therefore, who came first as ruler of “the under¬ 
world,” Nergal or Gilgamesh, or whether these two should really be 
the same, which we doubt for the time being. Yet, we have already 
heard (pp. 437b, n. 22) that Nergal’s name MES.LAM.TA.E.A. was 
given to Gilgamesh. As Lambert states (La Legende de Gilgamesh , pp. 
39b): “After his life on earth Gilgamesh became king of the under- 

41 See R. Eisler, Orphisch-Dionysische My sterien-Gedanken in der christlichen 
Antike (1925; repr. 1966), pp. 246, 248. Compare also the “epitheton” of Ugaritic 
Baal, ‘ altyn , and its possible derivation from Hebrew ‘allon (‘elon), Oak, There- 
bynth, holy tree, and allanati as name of the fourth month, i.e., the month of 
Tammuz. (H. Birkeland, Norsk Tidskrift for Sprogvidenskctp 9 [1938], pp. 338-45; 
W. Robertson Smith, The Religion of the Semites [1957], p. 196, n. 4.)

world, a Babylonian Osiris. A formal statement of this is given in a late 
religious text: ‘Meslamtaea is Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh is Nergal, who 
resides in the underworld.’ This comes from one of the texts which 
explain the functions of deities by equating them with other gods or 
goddesses, a very significant type of exposition.” 

This “significant type of exposition” is, in fact, the technique of the 
Old Norse skalds, and we have some perfect kenningar from Meso¬ 
potamia, such as “Ninurta is the Marduk of strength,” “Nergal is the 
Marduk of battle,” “Nabu is the Marduk of business,” 42 “Enzak is the 
Nabu of Tilmun.” 43 Now, the passage quoted by Lambert says: “ d gil- 
games d nergal (u.gur) asib (dur) ersetim iim .” In the text (quoted above) 
that addresses Gilgamesh as “supreme king, judge of the Anunnaki . . . 
you stand in the underworld and give the final verdict,” it is again 
ersetu , and according to GE 72.56 it is ersetu that has seized Enkidu. 
Thus, that line might try to tell us “Gilgamesh is the Nergal of Ersetu,” 
whereas Nergal’s own “underworld” is Aralln (Aralu). Says Albright: 44 
“Eridu is employed as a name of the apsu, just as Kutu (Kutha), the 
city of Nergal, is a common name of Aralu.” Thus, it would be the 
very confidence in the custom of giving many names to the same topos 
—and in “synonyms” in general—which enforces, so to speak, distorted 
translations. It is a matter of course that the final decision will rest with 
those who know Sumerian and Akkadian, in the future: spontaneous 
angry refusals should not be accepted. Taught by bad experience 
with the Egyptian dictionary ( Aegyptisches W orterbuch) that renders 
thirty-seven Egyptian special termini with the one word Himmel, we 
suspect the Assyriologists to handle their “underworld” accordingly— 
and their “heaven,” of course. The authors of the Assyrian Dictionary 
do try to be as specific as possible, admittedly, so they deliver several par¬ 
ticular significations of ersetu (vol. 4 , pp. 308-13): “(1) the earth (in 
cosmic sense); (2) the nether world; (3) land, territory, district, quarter 
of a city, area; (4) earth (in concrete sense), soil, ground, dry land”; 
but translations being a function of the expectations of the translator, 
the categories are bound to look fundamentally different, once several 
of them are expected to represent sections of the sphere.

Hamlet’s Mill • 450 

Hut where docs the proportion, Gilgamesh belongs to Ersctu, Ncrgal 
to Arallu, lead us to? This is not yet to be made out properly; too many 
riddles lurk behind every word. About the mcs-trec, Marduk knew to 
tell (in the Era Epic) that it “had its roots in the wide sea, in the depth 
of Arallu , and its top attained High Heaven,” asking Era reproach¬ 
fully “Because of this work which thou, o hero, didst command to 
be done, 'where is the mes-trec, flesh of the gods, adornment of kings?” 
(S. Langdon, Semitic Mythology [1931], p. 140). Concerning the 
Mashu mountain (Mashu = twin) watched by the Scorpion-men, the 
GE says: “Whose peaks reach to the vault of heaven (And) whose 
breast reach to the nether world below,” this “nether world” being 
Arallu. We knew all the time, certainly, that we were up to Scorpius 
(probably with a part of Sagittarius), but the huge constellation offers 
sufficient space for more than one way of descending. It is for this reason 
particularly that we hope for a better understanding from the Indian 
lunar mansions (1) lambda upsilon Scorpii, alias “the root,” alias “the 
tearer out of the root,” alias “Yama’s two unfasteners,” and (2) Antares, 
“the eldest,” alias “who slays the eldest”: in the sense of Precession, the 
sting of the Scorpion antecedes Antares. 

If we knew the precise “extension” of the Scorpion-goddess (Ishara 
tamtim, Egyptian Selket) we should be better off. And this is the 
reason: GE Tablet 7, col. 4, iof., dealing with Enkidu’s alleged sick-bed 
hallucinations, makes Enkidu prophesy to that “harlot”—in the texts of 
Boghazkoi it is she who has the name Siduri—who had lured him into 
the city: “[On account of thee (?)] the wife, the mother of seven, shall 
be forsaken.” (Speiser: “[On thy account] shall be forsaken the wife 
(though) a mother of seven.” Ebeling, AOTAT, p. 105: “[Urn deinet- 
willen soil] verlassen werden die Mutter der sieben, die Hauptgattin.”) 
This “mother of seven” should be Ishara tamtim, the Scorpion-goddess 
whose seven sons are notorious with her 45 —it is preposterous, anyhow, 
to associate one or the other righteous housewife in Uruk or elsewhere; 
but whenever well-bred scholars meet a “harlot” they accept it as their 
duty to discover moral lectures in the text surrounding her, very touchy 
they are! The first part of the line, however, is not in existence, and it 
is, again, their expectation that urges the philologists to supply “[On 
account of thee (?)].” Here, for a change, Freud would come in handy, 
but for the sake of the translators, not for the text. The readable part of 


45 Meissner, Babylonien mid Assyrien 2, p. 26; Edzard, Wb. Myth., p. 90. 









451 * Appendices 

the line states nothing else but that “the wife, the mother of seven shall 
be forsaken.” But since we do not know yet the whole extension of 
the Lady Ishara tamtim who was going to be forsaken, we still do not 
know the position of Gilgamesh’s “new way”—to ersetu } as we assume, 
or by way of ersetu. Ersetu might have replaced Ishara tamtim, because 
we learn right in the beginning of the Era Epic (Tablet 7.28-29, Goss- 
mann, p. 8) that Anu begets “the Sevengods” (^SIBP 1 ) on Ersetu, trans¬ 
lated “the Earth,” as companions for Era. The one who doubts that 
“begetting” is done up there might begin to ponder over the Hurrian 
texts, where MAR.GID.DA, the Big Dipper (alias the Seven Rishis), 
begets twins on “the Earth.” 46 It is evident that we are still far away 
from the first among the proposed goals, but we prefer to confess to 
this state of things rather than fall into the bottomless pit of speculation 
—the very many inviting pits, respectively. 

46 The Big Dipper does it on the order of Ea. See H. Otten, My then vom Gotte 
Knmarbi. Neue Frag?nente (1950), pp. 7f.
