      <description>Constellations Constellations are patterns of stars which aid in describing locations of various celestial objects. They are associated with colorful tales which motivated the ancients of various cultures - a great mnemonic (and spiritual) device!
Various stars in a constellation are often identified with greek letters - like apha centauri, alpha virginis.
 &amp;ldquo;Starting from Tilak, it has been proposed the that dogs (Canis Major and Canis Minor), Bear, Draco, Hunter (in Hindu world moved to Canis Major on occassions); mR^iga and other constellations were known and figured distinctly from the ecliptic divisions in the form of the nakShatra-s.</description>
