## Intro
- Meteoroid → enters atmosphere → meteor → hits ground → meteorite
- Every year a flux of at least 10⁷ kg of meteorites reaches the earth

## Meteoroid types
### Origin
- pieces of other planetary bodies like Mars, the asteroid Vesta and the Moon.
- others are the dust of comets or fragments of cometary nuclei. These are behind the meteor showers which occur when the earth crosses a cometary orbit.
- material left from the collisional and accretionary process that formed the rocky planets. Such collisions continue to occur in the asteroid belt generating meteoroids. 

### Material
- Iron - probably the first source of iron used by humans sometime before the regular iron age
- Stony Iron
  - divided into chondrites which have “chondrules” and achondrites. Chondrules are crystalline material derived from molten silicate droplets.
  - The shergottites and related Martian meteorites are typically classified as achondrites. "the shergottites have been reliably shown to contain aromatic and alkylaromatic hydrocarbons, phenol and benzonitrile."
  - Some are carbonaceous - contain organic material. Eg. Murchison.
- Stony

## Origin of life and its building blocks
- Considered elsewhere.
